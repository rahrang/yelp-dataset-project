Food, bars, and shopping all within walking distance. Location, location, location.\nVery clean and very good maid service\n\nCons:\nTiny rooms \nUncomfortable bed \nAbsolutely no amenities \nNo phone in room \nNo wardrobe \n\nWas given a lot of attitude about me and my husband sharing a room which was quite strange and we were charged 15 pounds more for double occupancy not sure why that matters I felt like it was a money grab. It was just handled in a kind of odd manner to me... \n\nIf you book this hotel all you get is a bed, desk, and a bathroom. It isn't awful but know what you're getting into.",

We ended up talking to the couple next to us and sharing a few bites of items which was interesting. It's hard not to when sitting so close to someone. \n\nWe started with the classic foie gras which was delicious, the homemade bread was the best ever.\n\nWe had some of our neighbors brussel sprouts and lamb.\n\nThen came our beef for two, which was probably the best beef dish I've ever had. It was perfectly cooked and seasoned. \n\nOur waiter was great, I'm not sure of his name he was very nice and helpful since neither of us can read or speak French we were completely dependent on him. \n\nMy complaint would be that the beef for two is WAY, WAY too much food for two people. We were obviously visitors to Montreal and I felt so bad about wasting the food. Please either do a smaller portion or warn patrons.. The beef is enough for four! \n\nAlso if you are sitting on the patio/garden bring your shades!",

Started with the goat cheese and fig which was very good then both me and my husband had the lamb chop, and ended with the cheese plate with chutney. The only down side is when we made the reservation the lady said we only had 45 minutes to eat and they would kick us out even if we weren't done... We ended up getting to the restaurant early and it was dead (it picked up later) but we asked for any time so not sure why she needed to put us down for later and rush us... Did feel very rushed through dinner because of this so what could have been 5 stars is a 3.5 experience overall. \n\nYou definitely need a reservation so be sure to make one.

        "text": "Mittlerweile gibt es in Edinburgh zwei Ableger der Motel-One-Kette - diese hier ist eher das schlechtere.\n\nWir hatten auf unserer Schottlandtour die Gelegenheit beide Ableger kennenzulernen, da wir beide Nächte in Edinburgh (am ersten sowie am letzten Tag) in einem der beiden Motel One's verbrachten. Von diesem hier waren wir nach dem überraschend positiven Erlebnis im Motel One an der Princes Street [1] etwas enttäuscht.\n\nDas Hotel ist wesentlich größer und extrem unübersichtlich. Da man auf der fünften Etage noch Teile eines weiteren Gebäude, das mittels einer Glasbrücke mit dem Hauptgebäude verbunden ist, hinzugenommen hat, kann die Suche nach dem Zimmer insbesondere auf dieser Etage zu einem Gang im Labyrinth ausarten. Habe ich so noch in keinem Hotel erlebt - uns begegneten immer wieder Menschen, die sich auf der Suche nach ihren Zimmern verirrt haben.\nUnser Zimmer war ähnlich aufgebaut wie das Zimmer im Motel One Princes Street - befand sich jedoch im Inneren des Gebäudes und hatte daher kein Fenster. Nur eine kleine Dachluke, die sich am oberen Ende eines etwa 3m langen Schachts befand, sorgte für einen minimalen Anteil Tageslicht im Zimmer. diese Luke ließ sich auch nicht öffnen, nur ein elektrisches Rollo ließ sich mittels eines Schalters öffnen bzw. schließen.\nSonst gilt für das Zimmer eigentlich das Gleiche wie für das Zimmer im im Motel One Princes Street: Relativ klein, trotzdem extrem ansprechend und schick gestaltet und clever durchdacht. Dazu sehr ruhig.\n\nIm gesamten Hotel gibt es kostenloses WLAN für die Dauer des Aufenthalts für maximal 3 Geräte.\n\nDie Lage des Motel One Royal Mile ist großartig. Vom Airlink-Flughafenbus kann man quasi in den Hoteleingang stolpern, es sind maximal 50m. Zur Royal Mile sind es etwa 100m Luftlinie (bergauf) und man benötigt etwa 5 Minuten bis dort.\n\nDas Frühstück für 9,50 GBP / Person kann man nutzen - muss man aber nicht. Es ist eher übersichtlich und kontinetaler Prägung, trotzdem aber sehr gut. Für den gleichen Preis oder weniger bekommt man aber problemlos ein reichhaltiges Frühstück in einem der zahlreichen Cafes von Edinburgh.\n\nFür ein oder zwei Nächte kann man hier problemlos bleiben, sollte aber nicht allzuviel erwarten. Hat man die Wahl, sollte man meiner Erfahrung nach lieber auf das andere Motel One an der Princes Street ausweichen. \n\n\n----\n[1] http://www.yelp.de/biz/motel-one-edinburgh-2?hrid=7UDwl3s_DuOokkGPZXZgBw",

        "text": "Wahnsinn - un-fass-bar gut. Wer auf ehrliches, bodenständiges Barbecue steht, kommt hier voll auf seine Kosten.\n\nReekie's Smokehouse bietet Hausgemachtes aus dem Smoker. Pulled Pork, Pulled Beef und Spare Ribs - aber auch Vegetarier werden dank vegetarischem Haggis nicht verhungern.\nAls Beilagen stehen die klassischen Fritten, aber auch Coleslaw, Bohnen oder eingelegte Gurken zur Wahl. Die Fritten waren dabei der Hammer. Wirklich unglaublich gut... Super dabei: es stehen verschiedene Würzungen zur Wahl, wie z.B. geräuchertes Hebridensalz, \"Meat Dust\" oder das Geheimrezept des Hauses. Die Portion war riesig und reicht locker für zwei.\n\nMein Pulled Pork Burger war perfekt. Zart, saftig, leckeres Raucharoma. Darauf Coleslaw und alles in einem selbstgemachten Brötchen.\nDazu gibt es eine Soße nach Wahl, die auch allesamt selbstgemacht sind - meine Wahl fiel auf die \"Irn Bru BBQ Sauce\", eine süß-würzige, dünnflüssige Barbecuesoße auf Grundlage des schottischen Nationalsoftdrinks Irn Bru. Sehr lecker! Darüber hinaus gibt es weitere, ausgefallene Soßen wie z.B. die \"Whisky Jerk\", eine karbisch angehauchte Variante mit Whisky.\n\nAuch die Spare Ribs meiner Begleitung waren super und wie man das aus dem Smoker kennt: wunderbar zart, sodass sich das Fleisch fast schon nur vom Ansehen vom Knochen löst. Das Ganze lecker mariniert mit einem tollen Raucharoma.\n\nDazu bietet der Laden noch eine riesige Auswahl an Craft Bieren (Ich habe mich für das Brew Dog \"This. Is. Lager!\" entschieden, super!), kalte und warme Getränke und diverse Desserts.\n\nVorsicht: Der Laden schließt, sobald alles ausverkauft ist. Auch kann es vorkommen, das Nachmittags oder Abends verschiedene Gerichte schon aus sind - das steht dann auf einer Tafel über dem Tresen.\n\n\nKlasse Laden, unbedingt empfehlenswert. Für mich ein Pflichtbesuch, wenn ich in Edinburgh bin.\n\nWLAN-Passwort: meatandbeer",

        "text": "Super, klare Empfehlung!\n\nDas Motel One an der Princes Street besticht vorrangig durch seine perfekte Lage im Herzen Edinburghs. Der Hauptahnhof Waverley Station liegt nur etwa 100m Luftlinie entfernt, hier halten auch die Airlink-Busse vom Flughafen sowie die \"neue\" Tram. Direkt gegenüber vom Motel One Princes Street liegt das Nobelhotel \"The Balmoral\", zur Royal Mile mit dem Edinburgh Castle an ihrem oberen Ende benötigt man zu Fuß maximal 5-10 Minuten.\n\nTrotz der zentralen Lage ist es hier ziemlich ruhig. Wir hatten ein Zimmer zu einem der beiden kleinen Innenhöfe - bei geöffnetem Fenster konnte man Polizeisirenen in der Ferne hören, bei geschlossenem Fenster herrschte absolute Ruhe.\nInsgesamt sind die Zimmer hervorragend gedämmt. Von den Nachbarn oder vom Flur her war ebenfalls nichts zu hören.\n\nDie Zimmer waren - dadurch, dass dieses Hotel der Motel One-Kette noch recht neu ist - pikobello. Sauber, aufgeräumt und ohne erwähnenswerte Anzeichen von Verwohnung.\nDie Zimmer sind natürlich verhältnismässig klein - eine Präsidentensuite sollte man hier nicht erwarten. Sie bieten allerdings absolut ausreichend Platz und sind clever durchdacht, sodass man auch ausreichenden Stauraum findet. Zudem sind sie modern und recht stylisch im typischen Motel-One-Stil gestaltet, inklusive Aquarium-Animation auf dem TV, sobald man den Raum betritt - nettes Gimmick. Die Ausstattung im Bad ist hochwertig und modern.\nEin besonders nettes Feature: Eine zusätzliche europäische Schuko-Steckdose neben dem Bett! Hat man seinen Adapter vergessen oder möchte mehr als nur ein Gerät anschließen, hat man hier die Möglichkeit.\n\nÜberrascht waren wir auch vom Service - wir wurden auf Deutsch begrüßt. Hängt wohl auch damit zusammen, dass Motel One eine deutsche Hotelkette ist und hier auch einige Deutsche arbeiten. Der Service war insgesamt sehr freundlich, aufmerksam und professionell.\n\nDas Frühstück (9,50 GBP / Person) war übersichtlich und eher kontinentaler Prägung, aber in Ordnung. Die Frühstückslounge mit den großen Fenstern zur Princes Street hin ist großartig.\nFür den gleichen Preis bekommt man allerdings auch in Edinburgh locker ein reichhaltiges \"Full Scottish Breakfast\" mit Getränk dabei. \n\nWLAN gibt es im gesamten Hotel kostenlos für bis zu drei Geräte.\n\nDer Hoteleingang ist evtl. etwas schwierig zu finden. Steht man direkt vor dem Hotel, findet man im Erdgeschoss nur einen Apple-Store - ohne irgendeinen Eingang zum Motel One. Dieser befindet sich in der kleinen Seitenstraße um die Ecke, etwa 20m weiter. Von hier fährt man mit dem Aufzug in den ersten Stock zur Rezeption oder geht einfach die Treppe hinauf.\n\nIn Edinburgh existieren mittlerweile zwei Motel One-Ableger - einmal dieses hier, an der Princes Street und ein anderes, etwa 300m Luftlinie entfernt, an der Ecke Cockburn Street / Market Street [1]. Wir übernachteten während unseres Schottland-Trips am Anfang eine Nacht in dem einen und am Ende eine Nacht in dem anderen Motel One.\nHat man die Wahl zwischen beiden, sollte man sich definitiv für dieses Hotel hier entscheiden - es ist die um Welten bessere Variante! Ruhiger, kleiner, ansprechender gestaltet.\n\n\n----\n[1] http://www.yelp.de/biz/motel-one-edinburgh?hrid=ne5WhI1jUFOcRn-b-gAzHA",

        "text": "Mercat Tours ist einer dieser Anbieter, die zahlreiche unterschiedliche geführte Touren durch Edinburgh anbieten. Dabei reicht das Angebot von Touren über die Royal Mile und durch die Old Town über diverse \"Gruseltouren\" bis hin zu privaten Führungen.\n\nHighlight dabei: Mercat hat Zugang zu den Katakomben der Blair Street Vaults. Dieses verzweigte Tunnel- und Gewölbesystem ist entstanden, als man Ende des 18. Jahrhunderts damit begann, an den Seiten der South Bridge hohe Gebäude zu errichten. 18 der 19 Brückenbögen wurden somit zwischen diesen Gebäuden dieser ersten Einkaufsmeile Edinburghs eingeschlossen, nur der bis heute sichtbare Bogen am Cowgate blieb übrig.\nDie eingeschlossenen Bögen wurden in Keller, Gänge und Räume unterteilt, es wurden Zwischenetagen eingezogen und die Räume zunächst als Lager und Werkstätten für die oben an der Brücke liegenden Geschäfte genutzt. Allerdings war die Brücke chronisch undicht - man hatte einfach vergessen, sie abzudichten. In einer regenreichen Stadt wie Edinburgh fatal... Die Nutzung der 120 Räume als Lager für kostbare Güter wurde also schnell aufgegeben und die Blair Street Vaults wurden verlassen. \nIn den folgenden Jahren der industriellen Revolution wandelte sich die Gegend um Cowgate zu Edinburghs Slumgebiet, hier lebten die Ärmsten der Armen - die sich letztlich auch Wohnraum in den verlassenen Räumen unter den Bögen der South Bridge suchten. Die Gewölbe wurden berühmt-berüchtigt für Armut, Verbrechen, Prostitution und allerlei unerklärliche und schreckliche Geschehnisse, so sollen auch die bekannten \"West Port murderers\" Booke und Hare hier im 19. Jahrhundert ihr Unwesen getrieben haben und die Leichen an den Anatomieprofessor Doctor Robert Knox der nahegelegenen Universität verkauft haben.\nGegen Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts wurden die Räume nicht mehr genutzt, mit Müll und Schutt verfüllt und vergessen. Erst in den 1980ern wurden sie wiederentdeckt und erforscht. Seit den 1990ern bietet Mercat hier Führungen an.\n\nLaut BBC zählen die Gewölbe unter der South Bridge zu \"Britain's most haunted places\" - nicht verwunderlich, bei den Geschichten, die sich um diesen Ort ranken. Noch weniger verwunderlich, dass Mercat also auch \"Ghost tours\" durch die Blair Street Vaults anbietet. Hierbei wird man von einem professionellen Guide und \"Storyteller\" geführt und bekommt allerlei gruselige Geschichten erzählt, das alles im Kerzenschein in den dunklen, feuchtwarmen Räumen.\nLeider waren viele der Geschichten zu sehr offensichtlich aus den Fingern gesogen und die unzähligen Anmerkungen bei jeder Gelegenheit, was schon für unheimliche Dinge auf dieser und jener Tour passiert wären waren irgendwann etwas albern. Mag aber auch an mir persönlich liegen...\nTrotzdem: Die Tour in die Gewölbe lohnt sich absolut und bietet einen interessanten Einblick in die Vergangenheit. Wer auf Geistertouren steht, kommt hier sicher auf seine Kosten. Ansonsten gibt es ja noch die klassischen History tours ;)",

Dazwischen liegen etwa 10 über die Innenstadt verteilte Haltestellen und nur knapp 30 Minuten.\nDer Bus fährt 24 Stunden täglich und kommt zu den Stoßzeiten im Abstand von wenigen Minuten.\n\nAn Bord des zweistöckigen Busses befinden sich videoüberwachte Gepäckablagen (unten), gemütliche Sitze, teilweise mit Tischen, Steckdosen und USB-Buchsen zum Laden des Smartphones und als kleines Extra gibt es kostenloses und recht flottes WLAN an Bord.\n\nRelativ günstig ist das Alles auch noch: 4,50£ kostet eine einzelne Fahrt für einen Erwachsenen, 7,50£ die Hin- und Rückfahrt. Kinder zahlen 2 bzw. 3£.\n\nVom Flughafenterminal komfortabel direkt in die Innenstadt - das Ganze auch noch unkompliziert und bezahlbar. Was will man mehr...?!",

Hierfür braucht man etwa 30 Minuten, die Fahrt kostet knapp 7,50£. Seit einer Weile gibt es nun auch die Tram, die den Flughafen ebenfalls mit der Stadtmitte verbindet.\n\nDie Check-In-Halle ist übersichtlich, zu den Abflügen gelangt man im zweiten Stock. \nDie Sicherheitskontrolle habe ich immer als sehr strikt aber auch als vorbildlich organisiert (man ist schließlich unter Briten), professionell und zügig erlebt.\n\nDie Abflugshalle selbst ist ebenfalls übersichtlich, hier gibt es etwas mehr als 10 Gates, von einem Ende zum anderen braucht man maximal 10 Minuten.\nHier gibt es ebenfalls zahlreiche Cafes und Bars, Duty-Free-Shops sowie ein Running Sushi.\n\nEs stehen zahlreiche Sitzgelegenheiten zur Verfügung, es ist sauber und es gibt ausreichend Toiletten. Die Beschilderung ist klar und übersichtlich und die Atmosphäre wenig hektisch und sehr angenehm.\n\nEinen schottischen Whisky aus dem Duty-Free-Laden mitzunehmen lohnt sich meines Erachtens kaum. Die Preise sind hier immer noch recht hoch - in Deutschland sind die Flaschen kaum teurer, eher günstiger.",

They are very helpful and have a lot of patience answering all my questions about where to go etc. there is also a lounge open 24 hours with snack-type food. Breakfast is continental-style so if you want heartier fare look elsewhere though you don't have to go far. The bus and train stations are right across the street so it's easy access to the airport or anywhere else you may want to go. Turn uphill to old town or cross the bridge to new town. The room with a view i got was spacious and comfortable though it's a bit of a maze to find it-just follow the signs. The windows are double paned so the room is quiet plus i was on the 5th floor which helps. It's a bit pricey but still one of the best values i found!",

        "text": "I love this place. Truly. It's great energy, the food tasty, they're mindful of allergies and food requirements. So why 4 stars? \n\nThe price. \n\nI'm all for organic. It's all I aim to eat, and I'm learning the longer I'm in Toronto, the harder it is to find. \n\nSo, I know my prices, and I'm aware of how to make most things on the menu. Many are time consuming, and as a staffer pointed out, \"You can make the chocolate mousse at home easily. You can't the raspberry chocolate 'cake'\". \n\nStill, $23 for a burger and a loony-sized salad seemed extreme. $13 for a piece of cake, same thing. \n\nYes  it was delicious. I'll likely return. But the pricing is off. I mean, at least give me a handful of salad for my side. I literally finished what I had in one bite. \n\nThe ambiance is coffee house hipster chill, the WiFi free, the staff friendly, the bathrooms clean. \n\nI'd sit here daily and work, if it were a bit more affordable.",

They're the closest to us with the actual products we need. They have pills and packaged foods, aromatherapy supplies, that no one else carries. \n\nWhy do I dislike it? The fresh produce leaves much to be desired. Some of the prices are ridiculous, and staff don't pipe up to say anything. So for instance, I grabbed some dried kelp in the spice section. Maybe 3 Tb worth. Over $10. Wtf? No one says... Hey, you sure you want this? You could get it for less if you did this ... Nothing. But when I complained, I'd already bought it. No refunds on spices that I packed up myself. \n\nOr, the staff. It's like you're in a bad 80s valley girl movie with all the sighing and eye rolling. \"Oh my God, I GUESS I'll help you...\" is the feel. And don't get in their way if they're at the back of the store, in the maze by the produce. You will get shoved out of the way. I did. Repeatedly. \n\nFinally, the prices. Maybe it's the area, but there's a definite markup here, beyond anyone else in town. \n\nNot a fan. Please, someone offer their breadth of products with a smile and I'm a customer for life.",

While all the DAVIDs Tea stores rock my casbah, this one gets special points for it's friendly staff. \n\nI'm still not sold on it being a concept store (as was described to me, \"making DAVIDs Tea the Walmart of tea\"), but, I do like that there's always \"tea on tap\". At the same time... I prefer loose leaf, and I can't see it saving anyone any real time to grab a pre-made sachet over a scoop of loose leaf. But, what do I know, I'm just a (nerdy, tea-obsessed) customer. \n\nStill, there's something really light and lovely about this store. I've visited many a DAVIDs, I've spent hours in the one at Metrotown (Burnaby, BC) -- and this one is the most inviting of all the ones I've visited. The seats at the front overlooking the street, the staff, the feel... it's just perfect. There's nothing awkward about the layout (as there is in the DAVIDs at the Toronto Airport). It's just... a peaceful refuge.\n\nWhy not 5-stars? Hm, it's hard to say exactly. Maybe it's the higher prices of late, or that everything comes pre-sweetened. (I want flavored matcha that I sweeten myself!) I dunno. It's just not the 5-stars that I want it to be. That is, until I go somewhere that there isn't a DAVIDs Tea again. Then, I miss this store specifically.",

The woman who packed the creme brulee didn't bother taping it down and so it spilled everywhere in the box(liquid sugar covering everything). It was just okay, nothing spectacular. \n\nThe napoleon was also alright, nothing spectacular. I did like the opera cake but only get it if you REALLY like rich chocolate things (it can be kind of heavy towards the second half). I also ordered a cinnamon roll which was not bad; it was more of a danish flaky pastry than the typical fluffy cinnamon roll texture. \n\nOn the side with gelato, we did order a coconut flavored one. It was very coconut-y and actually not bad. The guy behind the counter was much nicer and much more patient than the lady behind the pastries.\n\nOverall, extremeley disappointed with quality of service and disappointed that the pastries weren't as spectacular as expected.",

        "text": "Stayed here for two nights, costs was £109 per night for two people sharing a room which was not a budget price for what felt like budget rooms. Firstly they don't have any twin rooms in the hotel which would be preferable when I was sharing with a friend not my lover! There is only one small bin which is located in the bathroom.  No soap, which I find ridiculous, only toiletries were a dual shower gel/hair wash. There was a hairdryer but no wardrobes or drawers. Room was also very cold. \n\nNow for the positive, the location is very good, close to princes street and St. Andrews square. The staff are very helpful and the bar is 24 hours. \n\nDon't bother with the breakfast which is £9.50 each for a continental breakfast where you can easily get a cooked breakfast in any one of the cafes in Cockburn Street, which is adjacent to this hotel. \n\nIf I go to Edinburgh again I will book a different hotel.",

I note that other reviews for this cafe are by personal friends of the owner which maybe why they have scored high. \n\nWe originally sat outside as there were no tables available, however moved inside as soon as a table became available as it was cold. We told the staff at the counter but they seemed unable to pass this info on. As first our drinks were taken outside and then we saw our food going the same way. When we stopped the gentleman who was serving our food he was quite rude about us moving tables! \n\nMy fried egg was undercooked and the bacon was poor quality. It was cheap but I would recommend paying a bit more and going to Southern Cross Cafe just up the road, unless of course you want poor quality food and bad service.",

The staff were very helpful, when we originally booked we didn't know how many there would be, we started off at 5 and ended up with 18. They let us have a semi private room which was fab for us and the other guests as we were a bit noisy.  They phoned us to confirm a few details and were just great. \n\nI had the duck breast and sweet potato side which were just delicious. Every single person in our party really loved their food. \n\nActually I can find no fault in their restaurant hence the first 5 star review I have ever given!",

My friend had haggis neeps and tatties, which were heavenly. \n\nThe decor is lovely with high ceilings and a central bar. Very spacious area, in a good location.

The gentleman that initially served us was pleasant as was the lady who took our order and served our food. \n\nHowever the food was not good. Pasta bake was too wet and much too much cheese. The haggis, neeps and tatties too dry. The mince with Yorkshire pud was made from very poor quality mince and was probably just purchased from Iceland. Worst of all was, I told them I was wheat and dairy free, I checked before I started eating my food if the waitress had checked and she said she had. Well she hadn't as I was ill later on. \n\nI would not recommend you go here if you like good quality food",

This chain is spreading fast over there and they're bringing their efficiency and attention to detail with them here. \n\nMotel One is, as the name suggests, aimed at the budget market. Rates for this venue range from approximately £69/night up. I booked ahead and appreciated the completely free reservation process with room guaranteed until 6pm on the day of arrival. If you give your credit card details, it's reserved beyond that time.\n\nLocation is excellent! If you exit from the Market St side of Waverly and turn right it's maybe 3 minutes away. It would be very hard to have it closer. That also makes it very close to the castle and Princes St. Welcome was warm and check-in easy. The lobby area is pretty small but clean and cosy with sweets, maps etc. There's a bar area down a few steps where they also serve the buffet breakfast each morning.\n\nMy room was the cheapest version and was internal, facing onto a courtyard. It had no view and was quite dark, but quiet. Everything was completely spotless. The bathroom was small but well designed and had a great shower. Bed was comfy with 2 single duvets. So continental, don't you know? I appreciated the tea and coffee making facilities (I'm like a beast without them), the decent sized TV and the free wifi. The hanging storage facilities are limited but it was fine for a few days. \n\nRandom: hands down the best hotel hairdryer I have ever used. And one of the best dryers in general-called a Black Mambo. It was worth staying there for that alone. Well, you know, also the really good value and the pristine conditions. But definitely the hairdryer.",

I strolled in laden down with groceries on the opening day, looking like a vagrant, but was treated like a red carpet worthy customer.  I was served by Maxine, the beauty manager, and she was simply lovely.  Very sweet, knowledgeable, sense of humour and not at all pushy.  I walked out happier than when i walked in and it was purely based on service received; not the cut price package of Pirate cookies that made it into my basket.\n\nThe store itself is medium sized but seems to pack pretty much everything in.  You have to scoot by the Beauty Boutique to get to the main part which is pretty sneaky.  It's so hard to resist all those shiny, colourful (and expensive) things.  It's a well stocked Beauty Boutique too with the usual Lancome, Clarins, Elizabeth Arden etc as well as Lise Watier, Benefit etc.   The rest of the store is sparkling (well, it is new) and full of the usual mixture of a few groceries, medications, cosmetics etc.  Staff were genuinely pleasant and everybody seemed happy to be there.\n\nThis one is  a keeper.  I'll definitely be adding it to my list of places to spend money!",

GoodLife doesn't seem to have quite so many issues so hopefully this won't be the case.\n\n \n\nThe gym itself is a nice space-very loft-like which is kind of appropriate for the Entertainment District location. There are lots of exposed pipes and polished concrete on the staircases etc. More importantly, it's clean. The changing rooms are actually pleasant and spotless with a little lounge area and hair straighteners! I wanted to stay there for the whole morning but I usually go to McCaul which is a complete dive and makes this place appear spa-like in comparison.\n\n \n\nEquipment is spread out over 2 floors. Lots of cardio machines which are pretty new and appear to work! That's another welcome surprise after going to McCaul. They're mainly a mix of Life Fitness and Precor. Love the built-in TVs. Such a relief not to have to fight over channel choice with a roomful of people. Weight section is decent enough. Dumbbells over 100lbs, a few squat racks, graded barbells...and a ton of machines for people that are into it. No kettlebells or TRX on the floor, sadly. Flooring is a mix of carpet and rubber. There is also a little \"Fit-Fix\" room which has some dumbbells, balls and mats in the corner and there's a separate personal training studio. THAT'S where they hide the kettlebells. They're apparently planning to add TRX training but it will presumably be limited to personal training clients only.\n\n \n\nThere's a pretty wide range of classes including spinning and the times are convenient too.\n\n \n\nStaff seem to be mainly former Extreme employees. The guy on the desk this morning was pleasant! Some of the trainers from McCaul GL are moving here and they're nice guys so that bodes well.\n\n \n\nRandom points: juice bar if you want to replenish any calories you might have burned and add a few extra for good measure. There's also a little business section with computers and a health centre.\n\n \n\nOpening hours: 5am to midnight weekdays, 8am-8pm weekends\n\n \n\nOverall: nice place! I'll have to check it out again during peak times though. Minus marks for not allowing the normal members to use kett",

It's a wonderful talent!\n\nThis store was on Bloor until a few days ago apparently.  I wandered in as part of my search for comfy lounging/pottering around the place trousers (pants).

This branch, despite being in upmarket Yorkville, still retains a really friendly feel and a relaxed atmosphere.

And they keep them for up to a year!\n\nThe good:\n-Gorgeous clothes\n-Great yoga accessories\n-Friendly staff\n-Free yoga on Sundays at 10am\n-Free hemming!\n\nThe bad:\n-The stuff is pricey.

        "text": "Great experience!\n\nI was specifically looking for somewhere that offered IMS (intramuscular stimulation) which is a type of dry needling. I'd had really good results with the technique previously and wanted to try it on my tight calves. A Facebook friend mentioned being treated here so I did a bit of investigating. \n\nThey're really quick to answer emails and very helpful! It took a while to organise an appointment-a mixture of them being busy and me having to work. When we managed to coordinate schedules, it was really easy. I was allowed to book by email and got a time that suited me!\n\nThe space is really lovely. It's all open in the centre with lots of light and shiny wood floors. Individual treatment rooms are off to the side which was really nice. Can't say I love going to physio and being in a row of beds as if it's an old style ward. I like my privacy! Especially when I'm paying for it.\n\nMy reception was friendly and I was given the usual intake forms and then it was just a short wait before my physio arrived. I had Carl who was fabulous. Really friendly, very thorough and excellent clinically. He picked up on stuff without me telling him which is always a good sign. He also didn't just look at my calves-he was more holistic and system-based which I also liked. There were moments when I didn't completely love him (like when he was putting needles into my chronically tight muscles) but overall I have only praise for him! I particularly liked it that he didn't try to book me in for more sessions. It was left open-ended...I can go back if I need to. I don't like being stuck going back forever and ever.\n\nRates are pretty standard I think. It's $110 for the first session which is stated to be 45 minutes. I think it was at least that if not slightly longer. Follow-ups are $60 for 20 minutes and $70 for 30 mins. I think most places are that expensive though. And I escaped with a one-off. Think my calves feel better. Despite disregarding all the post-procedure advice. Sorry Carl!",

I have been trying to cut down on my junk food this week but decided to allow myself Sunday treats.  The friendly girl in Little Nicky's had recommended the cupcakes in David's Tea so I just had to try them.\n\nThe so-so rating is purely based on poor service.  The Australian girl ignored the 2 customers (including me)  for ages while she chatted with the girl who was delivering boxes of cupcakes.  Eventually she got iced tea for the other person who had obviously been waiting since before I entered.  I asked about cupcake flavours.  There were 5 cakes on display, 3 flavours.  One was drumstick.  I asked what that was and she said \"like the ice-cream\" and turned away.  That didn't help since I have no idea what drumstick is so opted for peanut butter.  I remarked that the selection in the boxes that had been delivered looked better but she wouldn't let me have one because she hadn't sorted through them.\n\nCupcake-excellent.   Small but really yummy.  Probably the best I've had in Toronto so far.  $2.86 after tax.  If I could find the person who makes them I would set up a direct debit for a selection each and every weekend with extras on special occasions.   I've been incredibly disappointed by most cupcakes around so far but loved this.\n\nThe shop itself is really cute with a wide variety of teas and lovely colourful tea paraphernalia.\n\nService today though was rude, disinterested and unhelpful.  I didn't dare to ask about teas in case I would get my head bitten off.  Maybe I'll summon up the courage next time.  Or go back for more cupcakes.  But I'll check who's working there first....",

I was lucky that there happened to be a lull when I strolled by at 3pm on Saturday and they could take me without an appointment-apparently half the neighbourhood had descended on them to take advantage of the special offer.\n\nI decided on a shellac manicure-full price $35. I think I might have ended up with the owner. He definitely had divided attention. The boys who were on reception didn't seem to have a clue what they were doing and he was mainly talking to them and jumping up occasionally to sort things out. He didn't talk to me too much except to encourage me to come again. And he did thank me for trying them. My nails looked good when I left but are showing some wear and tear now after a week, when I'd hope to get 2 good weeks out of shellac. I like it that he gave me the buffer and file he'd used to take home!\n\nPrices aren't overly cheap at full price but not super expensive. For example: manicure is $16, pedicure $26, 60 min massage is $70 and full leg waxing $45. There will apparently be 20% off for a while until they get established.\n\nOverall it was fine. I'm going to try again and see if the organisation and attention improve once the crazy first week is over. My feet are like little hooves at the moment so it's probably worth the investment.",

        "text": "My headache is gone!  3 days of popping Advil and feeling not quite right with a niggly headache that I knew was coming from my neck and all gone after an hour under the magic hands of Johnny Vos.\n\nI was lucky enough to come across the recent Fabfind deal for discounted massages at Vos Massage Therapy.  I had a look at the website and was impressed by the photos and the bios of all the therapists.   I took what seemed like a risk at the time and bought 2 vouchers.  It's now seeming like one of my best decisions!\n\nI made my appointment around a week ahead of time.  The process was made incredibly easy by the online booking system which allows you to book by date/time/service and therapist.  They're open every day (with evenings on weekdays) so it's pretty easy to get an appointment.  I decided on Johnny Vos and a Sunday appointment.  They emailed with a reminder the day before.  I loved it that I didn't have to try to sneak a phone call to book in work or get calls I couldn't answer to remind me.\n\nThe clinic is on King St East and is accessed through a door right next to Petite Thuet.  The welcome from Johnny was warm and I felt comfortable immediately.  I settled down to my medical history form with a glass of water before we got started.  One of the other therapists was around and was also smiley and welcoming.  It made for a lovely atmosphere!\n\nWe headed into the treatment room which was cosy, restful and spotless.  We had a chat about my aches and pains, my job and how it contributes to my issues and any relevant medical history.  I got to pick music for the session and was then told that there were two rules.  Rules?  Eek!  Turned out they were that I was to let him know if he was hurting me-he could modify the technique to alleviate it; and that I was to ask any questions I wanted.  Best rules ever!\n\nThe massage was fantastic.  I'm picky and know a good massage.  I had a few trusted people at home who kept me mobile and clung onto them because there is nothing I hate more than a bad massage with someone who doesn't know what they're doing.  I hate it when it's too light/feathery strokey but also don't particularly enjoy the ones that are too pokey.  This was neither.  It was, quite simply, perfect.  He worked every bit of me from my toes to the top of my head and left me so loosened out and relaxed that speaking seemed like an effort.  The knots in my neck and shoulders were gently teased out so that I could move my neck like a normal person by the end.  He used a variety of massage techniques and heated pads throughout the treatment and checked in regularly to ensure that I was comfortable and the pressure was OK.  He knew when to chat and when to stay quiet and was careful at draping so that I never felt exposed.\n\nOn the way out, he handed me a bag of bath salts fragranced with the oils I had chosen for my massage and instructions to use them that night.  As he predicted, the bath and the scent relaxed me all over again and left me ready for bed (even though I'd also napped on the couch-was barely able to keep my eyes open after the treatment!).  I had a great sleep and woke feeling more refreshed than usual.\n\nThe whole experience was completely deserving of a 5 star \"woohoo! As good as it gets!\" rating.  Everything from booking to walking out the door was flawless.  The treatment was excellent and I was treated extremely well-like a favourite client, even though it was my first time there.  Johnny couldn't have been nicer-he's one of those people you just can't help but like--and he's also talented at what he does.  Having read through the bios on the website, it seems like all the therapists (registered massage therapists and acupuncturist) who work there are equally passionate about what they do so I'm confident a treatment from anyone involved would lead to equally floaty happy feelings!  \n\nI actually considered not posting this review-if they get more business it might make it harder for me to get an appointment-but my conscience wouldn't allow me to keep it a secret.  Everybody deserves a good massage.  I know I've found my place now!",

        "text": "I know some people think of going to the hairdresser as a kind of treat/spa session.  They see it as a pampering, relaxing experience.  Me?  I'd have root canals without anaesthetic more willingly usually.  I have hairdresser phobia.  I found a good hairdresser at home and refused to go to anyone else, even when I moved 150 miles away.  An addiction to Tabatha's Salon Takeover took my phobia to new levels. Basically, it's hard for a hairdresser to impress me.  \n\nI bought a Living Social coupon for a cut price cut, scalp treatment and blow dry at Darren Kwik's salon.  I decided to take a chance on using it-despite my fear of places without personal recommendations or multiple Yelp reviews. I hate having to phone so decided to try emailing about getting an appointment, fully expecting to hear nothing.   I was shocked and thrilled to get a speedy response and a time slot on the day I wanted!  It was so efficient and easy.\n\nAnyway, I kind of feel sorry for Darren and the challenge he faced on Saturday when I arrived into him.  I'd been to the gym so my hair was a mixture of damp and frizzy and dragged into a ponytail.  I'd thrown on shorts and a t-shirt after the gym so to say I looked \"casual\" is to put it kindly.  I left home too late so ended up jogging along a good bit of Queen West to his salon just slightly west of Trinity Bellwoods.  He was therefore landed with a glowing, scruffy, frizzy haired mess expecting him to make me pretty!\n\nHe rose to the occasion with not the slightest bother and was as calm as I was flustered.  His consultation was unhurried and really excellent.  I think he's the first stylist I have ever had who immediately worked from the fact that my hair is naturally curly/wavy and that I'd want a cut that would suit it curly or straight.  He talked about cutting layers to frame my face.  I asked him to try to keep the length in my hair.  He solved my query about why my hair felt so thin by pointing out how thin the longest layers had been cut previously.   He somehow managed not to be derogatory even when I told him it was ratty/wispy/terrible!  He didn't even scold me for colouring my own hair-he just gave advice on how to minimise damage.\n\nI liked that the salon is small (just 4 stations) and cosy.  It felt so calm and relaxing in there.  Everything was spotless and comfortable.\n\nHe washed my hair himself and gave me what was hands down the best scalp massage I've had in years and years.  I thought I was going to fall asleep on the chair!  We then settled into the main business of cutting.  He was reasonably quick-but in an experienced way, not in a rushing through it way.   His version of taking an inch off the ends was more like 3 inches...but to be honest I think it needed it.  I do wonder if a hairdresser's inch is a special measurement like a baker's dozen though.  I don't think I've ever had an actual inch cut off!  He chatted away a little while he was cutting but would have let me stay quiet if I wanted I think.  I sipped my coffee happily as he worked away.\n\nWhen it came to drying my hair, he asked what look we were going for and I blurted out \"partyish\" because I was actually going to a party that night.  He somehow managed to know exactly what I wanted and gave me a flicky look with movement and volume!  I swanned out the door with a new spring in my step and my hair looks much thicker and healthier after him.  He gave tons of advice on hair care without once pushing any particular product.  It was a pleasant experience and I gave the cut its real test this morning when it was time to dry it myself.  It went well!  It was much more manageable than before and he actually managed to keep a lot of the length.  I may have found my Toronto hairdresser!",

We were treated to them in work by someone who had spent a few weeks there and it was a lovely gesture so I feel a little bad writing a negative review.  The company delivered the cupcakes to work (downtown) for her which I thought was great service.  The cakes looked great.  Some were just regular cupcakes but others were decorated with fantastic chocolate lollies.  Because it was a hospital setting they had moulded lollies of nurses, bandaids, bones etc.  Very cute!\nUnfortunately, cupcakes aren't purely about the cute factor.  They're also meant to taste good.  The cake was pretty good-a light and airy chocolate.  The frosting was disgusting.   I will quite happily eat frosting all by itself usually but ended up spitting this out and dumping the whole thing.  It's not buttercream, it's not cream cheese; it's some kind of grainy, synthetic, whipped entity that just tastes of chemicals.  Generally if something has fat and sugar in it, I'll eat it but I had to draw the line when it came to these cupcakes.\nI liked the delivery and they looked so cute.  It was a shame that they were essentially inedible.  Is buttercream that difficult to master?!?",

        "text": "I wanted to check a couple of bloods so pottered along to my friendly local family doctor, Dr Stendardo at Appletree in Village by the Grange (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/appletree-medical-centre-toronto).  It was another efficient visit.  He printed off the necessary forms and I trotted off.  The laboratory indicated was this Gamma-Dynacare on Edward Street nearby.\n\nI Googled beforehand and found some one star reviews so I wasn't particularly hopeful.  I was worried about long waits because I knew I'd have to pop out of work to get the test done (their hours are pretty much office hours) so phoned one afternoon to enquire.  I was told I could go in right then if I wanted and the wait wouldn't be long.  I went the next afternoon instead.  It was the day before Canada day, just before a long weekend so I thought it would be busy and chaotic.  It was anything but.  The lab is on the 8th floor and I strolled right in with my form and OHIP card and presented them at the desk.  The friendly reception staff started entering my details and then directed me to a cubicle.  I had barely sat down when the phlebotomist came in to take my sample.  He was friendly and quick.  I barely felt the needle and next thing I knew I was collecting my OHIP card and heading back to work.  Couldn't believe how quick and easy the process was.  There had to be a catch!\n\nThere was no catch.  I was called to get my results the following Wednesday which was pretty efficient considering the long weekend in between.  No wait, friendly people, skilled phlebotomist and pretty rapid turnaround time?  Yes, I'm a fan!",

I'm on a budget and this is far too much temptation for me.\n\nI'd read about Titika on a lululemon lover's blog as an alternative for lululemon addicts. I browsed the website and was interested to see what the clothes looked like in real life. It was so exciting to see a real life store a few weeks later!\n\nThis location opened on September 22nd-I missed it because I was away but was in here this weekend to have a good old browse. It's like lululemon with an edge and I think better quality too. It's most certainly pricey-think $50+ for a tank top-but they have some lovely pieces. I left with one black top which I love today but have my eye on a few other things in there too. If I was in a slightly better place financially I would have left with lots more. The quality is excellent and they have some really unusual detailing on their tanks and tops. They do run a bit roomy though so it's likely you'll be sizing down. Got to love vanity sizing-particularly in athletic wear!\n\nStaff are super friendly. They even coped with my quite grumpy Sunday \"I'm wearing my ipod-don't bother me\" mood with good humour. They were fantastic for getting new sizes and recommending items/the correct size. The store itself is bright, clean and a really pleasant place to shop. It's not cluttered and is merchandised well. I even love their bags!\n\nI have a sneaking suspicion that I'll be upgrading this place to 5 stars soon. I love that it's a Toronto based company that is growing. I'm looking forward to seeing more of the fall/winter line. What I'm not looking forward to is trying to either stop myself from buying anything here or trying to figure out how to pay the visa. Maybe they'd let me work for clothes? I should email them!",

        "text": "High expectations really do set you up for a fall.  Even worse, I decided to wait until my birthday to visit here.  I spent ages reading through the extensive menu online, plotting and planning.  I went to the gym to earn my waffle(well, maybe 1/4 of it) and went in excited.  I suppose it couldn't really live up to the hype.\n\nI wanted a waffle with ice-cream but they had none.  I settled on mixed berries instead.   Eat in or out?  I wanted in.  It's cheaper and you get plates.  I also ordered coffee which is self serve with the bonus of free refills.  Total came to $10 which was more than I expected.  I got plenty of time to ponder the arithmetic as I waited and waited.  The menu said my waffle was $8 and coffee was $1 (tax included).  I'm no mathlympian but that's $9 the way I see it.  Eventually the cause was revealed when I was handed a to-go polystyrene container.  She'd messed up the order and forgotten I wanted it there.   And charged me extra.  The girl cooking (her daughter) scooped my waffle and fruit back out and onto a plate.\n\nThe food?  It looked good, despite the extra travel between containers.  Couple of slices of pineapple and melon.  Few fresh strawberries.  Sadly the rest of the fruit was mushy and preserved in syrup.  The waffle was OK but quite soggy and not especially tasty.  It was lukewarm.  The coffee was hot but weak.   The worst thing was the feeling afterwards-knowing that what I'd just eaten really wasn't worth the calories.  A waste of a treat to myself.\n\nThe owner herself was quite friendly and works very hard-no wonder she's so slim.\n\nBut, average and lukewarm food, mixed up instructions and then overcharged?  I think my diet will survive the temptation of Karine's.",

Or, should I say WHEN I win Lotto Max.  Apparently all you need to do is dream hard enough-according to Oprah's guests anyway.\n\nThis is a reasonably large Winners.  Unfortunately this doesn't necessariiy equate with a good one.  Cosmetics are reasonable, as are shoes.  I like their homewares section.  I have my eye on a lamp for my bedroom and there are always little bits and pieces to tempt there.  \n\nThere are racks and racks of clothes as far as the eye can see.  It's amazing how much stock they have and how little of it is wearable.  You really do need to be motivated to search through it all to find something decent.  I'm just too lazy so walk through only to give up after 5 minutes.  \n\nThere are sometimes some good finds like headphones, sweets and trinkets on the stands near the cash registers.  This is good considering the lines are often absolutely horrendous-the distraction is needed.  I feel my patience ebb away as the line slowly inches forward.  When you actually get to the top of the line, the checkout experience is mixed.  I've had some nice assistants but the guy today was terrible.  No eye contact, definitely no smile and he was basically just downright rude.  I don't expect my transactions to involve haiku or sonnets, but monosyllabic barking (bag? here!) definitely does not create my ideal retail experience.\n\nIn summary, I like it for the homewares and sometimes the cosmetics.  It's tolerable on a weekday evening when the lines are shorter.  Sometimes they're civil too...or even nice.  I'd definitely choose the one on Front St over this though.  I leave less grumpy!",

They were so friendly and full of beaming smiles! I don't know how they stay so perky. Our tour was narrated by Captain Sarah while Captain Kevin drove. I don't know how she copes with giving the same tour every day, but I enjoyed her jokes and learned a few new things about Toronto. \n\nI was a bit disappointed that it was a shallow, covered boat...but I suppose that's more practical. They stop at Centre Island half way through and you can choose to hop off and get a later boat back if you like. We were visiting on a weekday in June though, so they were only sailing hourly, with island pickups on the half hour.\n\nThe big test was what the parents thought of it and they were happy. Even my dad who can usually find something wrong and can never hear anything thought it was good! \n\nDownside for me was the infrequency of sailing in June. I wish it counted as their summer because half hourly departures would have been great.",

Delivery is free over $70.\n\nSummary: Payless shoes without the stench of cheap :-)",

Everything was sparkly clean and they had beautiful massage chairs with particularly classy foot baths. \n\nDiane was my technician and she was quite friendly.

I was concerned that I'd end up as one of those people with nails curling around to reach their soles if she did my nails each time! She did a pretty decent job overall. I can't say it matched the attention and thoroughness of my experience at Yeti Nails, unfortunately. They also didn't have many magazines-I eventually managed to score one when someone else left. Next time I'd bring a book.\n\nHours don't seem to be posted anywhere, but I think she said they're open until 8pm Monday to Friday and until 7pm on Saturday.

It's not like a manicure lasts that long (barely a week with me if I'm lucky) but I'm low maintenance and low budget.\nI strolled in here on the holiday Monday, lured in by the sign outside that mentioned $30 mani-pedis.  I'm so easily bought...\nAnyway-salon is quite new.  They only opened at the end of June.  It's a hair salon in front with a manicure station and dryers to the right and pedicure chairs towards the back of the room.  Decoration is great-huge mirrors, chandeliers etc.   There's also a piano and I was lucky that one of the other customers decided she wanted to have a go while I was there.  Free entertainment!   \nIt was kind of a strange day for them I think....they didn't have the full staff on because it was a quiet day for business.  It might be a different experience on a normal day-they were a little disorganised and distracted.\nPedicure was good.  She could have been a  bit more vicious with my little hooves but got a nice quickie massage of my poor Achilles and calves thrown in.  They have a nice range of OPI, Essie and China glaze polishes and I opted for purple toenails for a change!  It was good to see them opening sterile packages of clippers etc and I have to give her bonus credit for working around my right big toenail-my friend dropped me on it while doing some enthusiastic dancing before I left home a month ago cracking one side...and then I cracked the middle of it with the fridge door a few days ago.  She did a pretty good patch up/concealer job!  I managed to smudge the polish on the other big toe though which was annoying.\nI got my manicure in the chair while having my pedicure.  I have mixed feelings about this in general.  It's great for saving time but does take away from the relaxation of the pedicure.  The girl who did it was LOVELY though and did an excellent job.\nHad a chat with the hairstylist while I was there and may pop back to try the hair section.  Cuts are $20ish...but blow drying straight is extra.  All-over colour is $45-50 approx.

It was obviously my lucky day-just one person sitting there.  It had snowed earlier in the day so maybe the rest were sensible and snuggled under a duvet somewhere!  The website would have given me this information too-it gives approximate waiting times for all their clinics in Toronto.\n\nCheck in was ridiculously easy.

I'm not sure what she was-nurse/physician's assistant/receptionist?  She was very pleasant regardless and took a brief history which she entered on a tablet device.  The doctor was Dr Stendardo who was lovely-relaxed and friendly.   We chatted briefly about what I wanted, he asked all the right questions and covered a bit of health promotion too.   The prescription was entered electronically and printed off before I swanned out, delighted with a health care system that lets me turn up, be seen and be treated well for free.\n\nI'm sure you'd probably be better off with a dedicated primary care physician for chronic or complex illnesses; but for quick consultations or acute illness places like this are a great resource!",

Both experiences were really good.  It's busy there-especially the downstairs section. I don't think I'd wanted to be seated downstairs if I wanted a quiet lunch.  It's fun to people watch though and they have TVs over the bar if you want to catch up on a sporting event.  The staff are friendly and smiled even when the 1 year old decided that she really really wanted to try to dance on the table.  I had a bean soup the first time I went which was very tasty and came with some foccacia.   The girls were extremely happy with their calamari (and their wine).\n\nFor my second visit, we were upstairs which was much quieter.  I tried butternut squash soup which was just OK.  I found it a bit bland.  I had to ask for bread to go with it but our friendly (and attractive) waiter provided me with a plate of fresh, crusty bread in a snap.  My friend had a panini which came with a big bowl of fries.  She found her panini tasty.  I thought the fries could have been tastier but still managed to deplete her serving so they obviously weren't that bad!  We deliberated over dessert and luckily the waiter wasn't annoyed-he just offered suggestions.  We decided to try the doughnuts some other time and shared the caramel copetta instead.  I think my friend described it best as \"like a fancy Snickers ice-cream\".  It was a great sweet and salty mix and there was enough to share if you just want something a little sweet after a meal.\n\nIt's by far the nicest place to eat in the Eaton Centre and you kind of forget where you are in there.

I really liked it when I first went, but now I love it even more.\n\nThe things I pointed out in my initial review still stand: they are incredibly personal and motivated to make absolutely everybody feel like they matter and allow them to reach their potential. I remember thinking that I'd have to be fit and in shape to try it, but I was completely wrong. They cater for everybody from those for whom the only Jim is the pizza guy and have never entered an athletic establishment to elite athletes. And everyone gets the same passion and gentle nudging thrown at them.\n\nIt's poised to get better and better too now. They're expanding into what used be the MMA side of the gym so there's more room for classes, squatting, deadlifts and the like. New toys have been bought and the class schedule is now jam packed with bootcamps, strongman, MMA training...and my favourite Steve classes: kettlebells and Friday morning circuits.\n\nTake my word for it: try the place. You'll love it. And you'll leave stronger, more athletic, in less pain and with the body you want.",

        "text": "First day here today....and my second Bikram class!\n\nI'm loving my Passport to Prana-I feel like I'm on a yoga tour of Toronto, constantly exploring.   I decided to go to the Sunday 9.30am class here and somehow managed to make it on time.  Phew!\n\nThe studio is downstairs with a small, bright reception area.  The staff were chatty and welcoming and checked about my prior experience (minimal).  I was advised again to stay in the room, drink water if I needed it etc.  Andrew told me he'd be the one inflicting torture on me for the day.   Sense of humour?  Bonus points!\n\nThe change rooms are really nice.  Ikea-esque furnishing with lots of black shelves and benches.  4 sparkling clean showers, couple of toilets, hairdryers and some lockers.  I love having lockers.  No thinking!  Towels and mats are available to rent.\n\nThe studio itself is modern and open.  Again it was completely spotless.  The floors are black wood with red lines to show you where to put your mat.  I had more trauma trying to figure out where the top of the room was to avoid accidentally placing myself in the front row again.  Tip:  the instructor has a big box/stage to stand on at the front....opposite the door.   All the walls are mirrored so you get to correct your posture from every angle...and/or watch how your face transitions from normal to pink to red to purple as the class progresses.  Fun!\n\nI enjoyed Andrew's class.  Most of the instructions were quite like my other class in Bikram Yoga Centre but he also told us why we were doing the poses in a certain way and was very good at describing adaptations and progressions.  He told little stories about his own practice which really made the class feel more easy going and was enormously encouraging.  He learnt all our names and dragged us through, pushing us as a group and individually.   He also had a sense of humour and fabulous enthusiasm-for the stick pose we were meant to look \"like a T! For Toronto!\" the first time....and \"like a T!  For TORTURE!\" the second time.  Made it (almost) fun!\n\nThe cool shower I had afterwards was just blissful and luckily they have dispensers in the stalls with some kind of shower gel/shampoo substance...I'd forgotten mine.  \n\nWould I go back?  Yes!  In fact, I'm seriously considering buying a class card....they've a special at the moment with 40 classes for $350.  Hmmm....tempting!",

Now my left hand looks good but my right hand is a bit messy and there's a chip already!  As I was leaving, one of them (who seemed like the manager) saw my face and said they would fix it for free if there were any problems.

I don't actually really know her, but I thought she was sweet and wanted her to do well!  That's my bias. I like to see good people succeed in things they're passionate about. One of my friends directed me to her Facebook page and her online clothing website so I'd been keeping up with her forays into fashion buying and saw her dream of real store of her own come true when she teamed up with her friend Angela, a designer. \n\nThe store opened over the Victoria Day weekend. It's an adorable little place next door to Chatelet on West Queen West. The decor is mostly white with a few eccentric design touches like a bike in the window and a stone angel. The white background is perfect for a store that is full of colourful and eye-catching clothing. The clothes are edgy and striking and they only buy a limited number of each thing so you'll avoid that awkward moment where you turn up to a party and see someone else wearing the same dress as you (which is even more gutting if they look better in it). They also stock designs by Angela herself too-even more exclusive! Despite the boutique approach, the only sticker shock you'll get is when you see how reasonable the prices are. I really thought things would be far more expensive!\n\nService is friendly and enthusiastic but not pushy. I was allowed to browse without being bothered which is always a big thing for me! It's also very important because it's the kind of place that's worth visiting repeatedly. The stock is changing constantly. I've loved keeping up with the Facebook page to see what new things are coming in: https://www.facebook.com/TheStoreOnQueen. \n\nGo have a look if you're out west!",

        "text": "I suppose I should preface this by explaining that I am probably not the target customer for a shoe repair bar in the Yorkville area. I wasn't bringing a pair of Manolos or Jimmy Choos; I was bringing two pairs of mid heel Hush Puppies. They're not fancy shoes but they're both my adored work shoes. Dressy enough to go with a skirt but I can walk miles in them. One pair is pretty battered-in fact I was spotted doing a bit of a DIY repair on them by a colleague who asked if I was really using a Sharpie on my shoes? Yes. Yes I was.\n\nSo, that preamble aside, I trotted into Roy's with my battered shoes in hand wanting them reheeled. The opening hours (which include Saturdays) were a big selling point. Roy was civil enough, but not really friendly. He took my shoes and the payment in advance-$14/pair. He said they'd be a few days.\n\nI called back to collect them and after watching him deal with another customer for a while, he called his assistant to get my shoes. The assistant found one pair in one of the drawers, then spent ages looking for the other pair which he eventually found on the counter between the repair area and shop. Almost as if they had just been done.\n\nAs for the reheeling? It was passable. There was a gap between the heels he attached and the heel of the shoe on both pairs. The heels are also wearing quickly. One of the heels twisted to an angle after a couple of wears. When I put on the other pair of shoes I noticed that they felt strange after a couple of steps and realised that the whole heel was coming off. I doubt that it was damaged in the shop; but nobody seemed to notice it when they were working on it.\n\nSo-it was basically fine but not great. I don't know if I just didn't come across well and that was why I didn't experience his charming side. Maybe my shoes were too crappy to spend a huge amount of time on. I don't think I'll be back though. I'm bringing my future repairs to my original shoe repair place-Gerry's. (http://www.yelp.com/biz/gerrys-shoe-repair-toronto)",

I'm kind of stuck with rating the TSO based on my personal emotional reaction to them and to the recent seasons.\n\nHonestly? I love them. I've been taking advantage of the $14-30 tsoundcheck tickets while I still can so I've seen a lot of these guys. They've become familiar faces and I've become kind of attached to them. I've actually gotten really fond of Peter Oundjian, the music director too. I love it when he bounces onto the stage full of enthusiasm and tells us about the pieces they're going to play. He's also put together an amazing season this year. It's been a struggle to stop myself from going to everything. They've  brought in wonderful guest conductors: people like Steven Reineke, Bramwell Tovey, Giancarlo Guerrero and Andrew Grams who I've. Rob Kapilow is also doing a series of \"What Makes it Great?\" concerts which are absolutely worth attending if you want to learn more about certain pieces.\n\nIf you're 35 and under, tsoundcheck is ridiculously good value for the quality of the performances. Even at full prices, you can get a ticket for $29 if you're willing to tolerate the balcony sides. And considering they get guests like Joshua Bell, Itzhak Perlman, Emanuel Ax, Yo Yo Ma and Yuja Wang; it's worth it.\n\nBooking through the website is generally easy. If there's a problem, the box office are easily contactable via phone and email. They're all incredibly pleasant. Particular shout-out to Alex Perala who has patiently answered all my tsoundcheck questions and made sure I got to all the concerts I wanted to see.\n\nAll in all, they feel like my symphony. I'm attached. I couldn't give them less than 5/5.",

She wasn't even slightly pushy which suits me perfectly.  I had a pair of shoes that I had bought in the Eaton Centre with me and was considering exchanging them for ones half a size bigger which they had in stock.

The voucher was for:\n30 minute relaxation massage\n45 minute oxygenating facial\nLife in the Metro manicure and pedicure\nActual value was $189, apparently\n\nThings started to go a bit wrong with booking. It looked so great! Their website had a specific link for group buy offers where you could enter your details and request a day/general time. I filled it all in on the Friday before my vacation week in mid-May and was looking forward to my treat. I heard nothing. I emailed them late the following week to be told that online booking didn't work. Great. Thanks for the warning on the website!\n\nMy voucher expiry date was July 15th. I was unable to get an appointment on that vacation week and they were booked up all weekends until mid August so I ended up booking this Friday (june 14th). I was lucky enough to have another week off; albeit a very busy one where I really didn't feel like giving up a few hours!\n\nI arrived at 3.20pm for my 3.30pm appointment and amused myself for 5 minutes while the girl on reception talked on the phone. I got myself some water and fidgeted a bit. When she was ready, she took my voucher and gave me a tablet to fill out details and medical details etc. I then waited until 3.45pm before someone came to start my treatment. She informed me that she was taking me because I looked like I was stressing about the time. Ouch. Must remember not to look at my watch when I'm being delayed. Naughty. No apology whatsoever from her.\n\nI was told to undress and lie face down for the massage. It was OK. It was certainly nothing like an RMT massage. It seemed random and haphazard. I wasn't very relaxed. Only positives were that it was neither too painful nor too light and feathery strokey. Facial was next and was also fine. I've no idea what products she used and don't recall being told about any oxygen. There was steam though. I dozed a bit because I was completely exhausted. It was over before I knew it! Probably because it was done by 4.35pm. Time for 30min massage and 45 min facial=45 minutes.\n\nThere followed a decent pedicure (with a massage chair that only did vibrate), a 15 minute wait for a manicure spot and a manicure that smudged on the way home. The aesthetician was nice enough but her top was filthy, she told me my eyebrows were terrible and she complained about the previous customers to me. They'd had the audacity to ask if they could shower after their treatment. In a spa. Imagine! \n\nDid I feel relaxed? During the facial, yes. But only then. They offer the same deal themselves and I wasn't even remotely tempted to buy. \n\nThe spa is also not very spa-like. When I think spa I'm anticipating an oasis and escape. This was basically a few very basic treatment rooms and a small nail salon. It looked nothing like the photos that have been uploaded here. I'm not sure they're even of the same place.\n\nPositives: nice glasses for water, cute basins and faucets for pedicure, clean, some staff seemed nice, location on the harbourfront\n\nNegatives: everything else",

However, that's pretty much the worst thing I can say about this place.\n\nI keep forgetting how good this place is. The first time I went I was a bit confused by how it works if you just want brewed coffee. You go to the cash desk first and tell them the size you're ordering, pay and they give you a cup. Then you saunter back to the large array of coffee jugs (ten!) and choose and pour yourself. They have  a range of roasts and flavours which I've been having fun trying. If I'm feeling adventurous I might even mix flavours: e.g. swiss chocolate almond + coconut = Bounty/Almond Joy without the 200+ calories! I'm easily amused. Staff are nice and it's really reasonable-a large (size of the new medium in Tim Hortons) is $1.75.\n\nThey have a range of teas as well and some little cakes and snacks. Haven't tried the cakes-they're covered in cling film which I'm not a fan of...and I've also happened to remember that I was meant to start dieting 18 months ago every time I go here. Perhaps I should go more often?\n\nThe rambling is basically to say-try it! Range of good coffees, not too spendy. Win win!",

First time I had underarms waxed and it was by the same woman who threaded my eyebrows in the Dundas location.  It was quick and painless and she was friendly.\nThe second time I decided on underarms and bikini and had a different younger girl.  Not so friendly and the bikini wax was poor. Patchy and she left a bit of tissue paper behind.   I felt like walking into the nearest salon for a redo.  She also had a very odd technique-she liked to cool the wax by blowing on it....on my skin.  It's just a little unsettling to have a stranger blow on your bikini line.  I struggled to suppress the uncomfortable giggles!\nThey have 20% off waxing on Tuesdays which is good but I'll be limiting myself to underarms in future!",

        "text": "So, to look at me you'd think I'd never darkened the door of anything resembling an athletic establishment. I think my Jewish boss would describe me as zaftig; however I am more pragmatic and will just admit that I'm chubby. The excess adipose is largely diet-related though-the chocolate just finds me. I'm a regular in the gym despite all that and usually work away by myself. \n\nI bought a group buy voucher for classes at DCC on a whim because I'd heard of the place and seen the website. At the time I was in no rush to change my routine so ended up using my voucher in a rush close to the expiry date. It turned out to be perfect timing as my routines were getting stale and I was losing enthusiasm. Steph was quick to answer all my emails and set me up for my first class!\n\nThe facility is great. They call it an athletic playground and that's pretty much what it looks like. Assuming you actually like to exercise, that is. There's turf in the centre with a hill, a section with weights, kettlebells and benches, an area with a cushioned floor and a dedicated area for Olympic lifting. They have many, many toys: ropes to climb, tires to flip, gorgeous Eleiko bars and weights, hurdles, kettlebells, bands. Pretty much everything. \n\nTheir class range is great! They tend to have early morning, lunchtime and evening classes-a mixture of bootcamps, female body sculpting, strength and power and high intensity conditioning. The bootcamps are G, PG and R rated. They've also rated the other classes-unsurprisingly, the high intensity conditioning is rated R!\n\nMy first class was the general bootcamp (rated PG) with Jimmy. I felt a bit lost at first just wandering over to the white board where people were congregating. He was friendly and cheery though and put us through a challenging workout of sprints, suicides, kettlebell swings, med ball jackknifes and the dreaded burpees. I left exhilarated! Second class was advanced bootcamp (rated R) with Blaise. It was a ton of fun. We were split up into small groups and ended up doing things like dragging a weight plate up the turf, band-assisted pullups, kettlebell swings, pushups, jumping in and out of a tire...and burpees. I did a general bootcamp with him the week after and it was completely different again and also fun. Pushups, pushing a plate, jumping. And of course burpees!\n\nMy favourite class was my final one-strength and power with Jimmy. He looked a bit doubtful when I turned up, explaining that it was focusing on Olympic lifts. I admitted that I was a beginner but said I'd love to learn some technique and he was fabulous. He was incredibly sweet and patient and would come to me, give me tips/pointers/corrections and then leave me to practice by myself. I really felt that I improved over the course of the hour. I would absolutely love to go again.\n\nNotes:\n-Bathrooms are small but clean and nice with 2 shower stalls, shower gel, hairdryer etc\n-They provide towels. Yay!\n-You leave your bag in a shelving unit on the floor so you can always keep an eye on it\n-Bootcamp classes can be big. There were 17 or 18 in some of mine. The class is capped at 20 but the large size means that you won't be getting much personal attention.  The strength and power classes are smaller\n-It would have been nice if they'd asked who was new at the start of the classes and asked us how we felt after/gave feedback. Or maybe that's just me wanting to be graded all the time!\n-They say that membership is approximately 50:50 male:female. The bootcamps tended to have a female predominance though (less noticeable in the advanced class) and the strength and power class was predominantly male.\n-They have a variety of membership options including:\nClass membership - $119 per month, fitness membership - Play in the Lair (gym access to do your own workout) - $99 (but $75 until July 31st, 2012) and unlimited membership - $150 per month. I think there may be a class card option too but I'm waiting to hear from them about it.\n\nAs for me? I hope they have some kind of class card option. I want to go back!",

        "text": "I spent a month in Washington DC once upon a time.  My local Safeway was affectionately known as \"Soviet Safeway\" because it was so grim and dreary.  The lovely Whole Foods nearby made it look especially bleak.  I like to think of this No Frills as \"no eye contact No Frills\".  The clientele are quite mixed to put it kindly.  There are some normal people, but many scary ones.  By the time I'd made my way around to the baking section I was starting to absorb the atmosphere and think \"what are you looking at?  I could take you!\".  Considering I'm a midget who couldn't fight her way out of a wet paper bag, I can only assume the adrenaline from the fear was driving me slightly insane.\n\nThere are definitely bargains to be found.   Far cheaper than Longo's/Metro/Loblaws for many things-although all of them have good prices at times if you shop the specials. The fruit and veg have looked pretty tired any time I've been in there.  The effort required to find some edible produce meant far too much extra time spent actually present in the place.  Probably best to go early in the morning.\n\nCheckouts are packed together like sardines.   The trolleys don't even fit through them all.  One cashier I had was nice, another was surly.  They were both moderately efficient though so I'm not too bothered.\n\nSo-worth a trip for the savings.  My advice is to keep your head down and get in and out without too much dawdling.  Remember-no eye contact!",

Probably because they have over 30 types of mustard ranging from sweet to super spicy and most of them are laid out daily for you to sample. Worst case scenario, you're dipping pretzels into yummy mustards and trying to decide between the maple mustard and the XXX hot. Best case? They have the bacon ready to go and you get your breakfast of bacon and mustard samples! At $6/jar or 3 for $15 it's at the upper end of the price range but totally worth it. These mustards are packed full of flavour so a little goes a long way.\n\nStaff are friendly, knowledgeable and not pushy.

        "text": "My friend K lives near Bistro 990 and was anxious to try it.  Her boyfriend was visiting Toronto for the weekend so she decided it would be a good excuse for a get-together combined with our first visit here.\n\nI had looked at a few Yelp reviews before visiting so was a little worried that it might be stuffy or pretentious.  It was anything but.  We were greeted warmly by Victor and led to a table at the back.  We had booked for 9 but only 6 eventually made it.  They weren't even slightly annoyed and we settled in happily.\n\nThe decor is a bit chintzy but actually works.  It is cozy and homely.  There's almost a family feel and it feels lived in; not stuffy.  Bathrooms downstairs are tiny but spotless.\n\nBread was plentiful, although it was cold.  I had one that tasted herby and didn't even require butter.  Most of the others had starters and tucked into them with gusto.  I tried the mussels and the snails as part of my continuing mission to eventually eat fish willingly.  They were actually tasty!\n\nFor my main course, I had the filet mignon which was a perfect medium rare.  I struggled to remove a chunk of fat-the lack of steak knife and candlelight made it a challenge-but once that was done I enjoyed it.   It came with some vegetables and potatoes in a peppercorn jus.  The portion was quite small for $32 but I suppose that's to be expected in a proper restaurant!  There were no complaints from any of the others.  I didn't actually get to taste any other dishes because they devoured them so quickly.\n\nThe dessert menu was full of things I wanted so I was staring at it with a somewhat panicked expression.   Our waiter suggested the special which was a Belgian chocolate mousse with almond ice-cream.  It was a good choice.  Dense, intensely chocolatey mousse which was offset by the freshness of the ice cream.  Portion just right again.  I got to taste the baked alaska too which was nice.  We agreed it wasn't really authentic-not baked to brown, just done with the blowtorch.\n\nWine was good but expensive-cheapest red was $55.  We went through a few too many bottles at that price!\n\nService was superb.  Victor was charming and our waiter was faultless.  My glass was never empty and he was extremely pleasant without hovering.  He even coped with my inability to choose a dessert with aplomb.  We were allowed to feel comfortable and at home for the whole evening.\n\nWill I be back?  Hopefully.  I have to work my way through more of the dessert menu.  I think I'll have to save my pennies first though...it's a special occasion location!",

        "text": "Went here on a group outing from work as our department Christmas dinner. \n\nReception at the front desk was warm and I was led upstairs to the group by the friendly girl on reception. We had been placed in a semi-private section upstairs with sliding doors that could be closed for extra privacy. Nice view of Adelaide St through huge windows so great potential for people watching!\n\nThey were pretty quick to take the orders. We had a set menu for $58. I ordered the chevre salad, tenderloin and carrot cake. The tenderloin was described as coming with roasted brussels sprouts and blue cheese fritters, heirloom tomato relish and worcestershire dip. I asked about getting some salad with it and was told no. I also enquired about some gelato with my carrot cake and was told it was either/or.\n\nBread was cold and not too exciting. It came with butter though which was nice. I'm Irish. It's what I was raised on! Starter was delicious. Beautiful caramelized chevre and a tasty salad. The entree was OK. The tenderloin was medium rare and tender. Not a huge portion. I didn't think the tomato relish went particularly well with it though. The handful of brussels sprouts were kind of bland and hard so I think they were undercooked. The 2 blue cheese fritters were probably the nicest thing on the plate. Would be lovely as bar food! I sampled some risotto too which was quite nice. I wouldn't bother to order it though. \n\nDessert choices were grasshopper parfait, carrot cake or cheese platter. I opted for carrot cake even though I thought the choices were pretty limited and poor! It was kind of a deconstructed carrot cake in 4 squares with some frosting on the plate, a drizzle of icing and some coconut swirls. Some pear was chopped on top. The cake itself was lovely and moist. It would be a lovely afternoon coffee cake. There was too little frosting though, the pear didn't go with it and the coconut was unnecessary. As a dessert after my Christmas night out it was a fail. The consensus on the cheese platter was also negative-my boss wondered when one chunk of cheese began to constitute a platter?\n\nService was pleasant and attentive without being obtrusive. The wines were good.\n\nUltimately, I think it would be a nice place to have the shareable menu at the bar. I wouldn't particularly rate it as a place to visit for the food. It's like they've tried to make bar food gourmet and edgy, but instead just ended up with a meal that was neither here nor there. I'm still bitter about the carrot cake-particularly since I emailed ahead and they told me I could have gelato! The question I suppose you have to ask after being brought out for a free meal is whether or not you'd go back and spend your hard-earned cash on it. I might consider the shareables etc, but for dinner (especially considering that the tenderloin is priced at $32.95)? No.",

        "text": "Eurgh!\n\nI wanted to give them my money.  I was pretty desperate to buy a TV having moved into a bare apartment and was badly in need of entertainment/something to fill the gaps.   I had my credit card out and was my muscles were twitching ready to hand it over.  They ruined it.\n\nMy salesman (Umang?) was all sweet and helpful, lots of \"thank you ma'am\"s etc.  He got the TV out.  We went to the register.  Then the pitch started.  I got 10 minutes of the Future Shop extended warranty talk.  He told me about how TVs were like computers these days, about all the things that could go wrong, about their no lemon guarantee, their in-home service, the disasters that surely would befall me and all my family and friends (fire, flood, pestilence, locusts...I think) if I did not agree to spend what amounted to 25% of the cost of the TV on their warranty.  He spoke so quickly my head was spinning and I was totally confused.  I generally make a point of NOT buying the extended warranty on anything other than expensive laptops but didn't know what to do.  I needed air and Google.  I said that I needed to think about it.  He was shocked \"what happened here?!?\".  I mumbled something about the warranty and he back-tracked saying I could add it later.  At that stage I was desperate to leave so fled.  He could have had a sale but instead I haven't even entered the place in 2 months.  Aggressive sales are the best way NOT to get me to buy something.  I later chatted with the guy in Tele City who said that the margin on cheaper TVs is so small that the stores make barely anything on them...hence the push for lucrative extended warranties.\n\nThey do have a good selection of products and all the brand names.  They often have good offers and sales.  My advice though?  Shop online or go in feeling \"fierce\" (ref Tyra Banks, America's Next Top Model) and having decided whether or not you want to hand over a wad of cash for a warranty.",

I just wanted an all-over colour to cover the grey though; nothing complicated.  Signing the waiver which basically absolves them of all responsibility should they totally ruin your hair is a bit concerning but I took a deep breath and went on!\nThere was no real wait and my student was nice.  Cannot remember his name though-Eric?  He showed me where to put my coat and gave me a gown, then brought me back to the ground floor.  I picked a colour myself-he didn't really seem to have much of an opinion one way or the other.  His instructor popped over briefly and gave some instructions.  I got coffee and he got on with it.  \nHe was careful to protect my hairline from dye and applied carefully.  The dye was a bit burny but not too bad.  He planned on emulsifying it for the lengths and ends so just applied to the roots.   I got a nice scalp massage to get it out which is always good.  Blow-dried straightish.  I couldn't for the life of me see the violet tones that were meant to be in the colour but reckoned they might be better after a few washes.  Instructor didn't come over to check work, even though he asked her.\n\nA few weeks later, it wasn't particularly violet but the fading was very obvious as were the patches of hair that were getting a \"dye holiday\".  The whole emulsifying idea didn't work very well.  It wasn't awful but I can miss bits all by myself.  Also, it's not particularly cheap at $50/$55 for just a straight colour.

I took the semi-accidental stumbling upon it as a sign to go get some so popped inside.\nThey had a little stand with a few cupcakes on it and the guy cheerfully went through the flavours.  Despite it being Saturday afternoon they still had a few left...with more flavours downstairs.  I was offered peanut butter/chocolate, chocolate with vanilla frosting, vanilla/vanilla, chocolate/chocolate, coconut, raspberry, chocolate mint and possibly more.  My brain takes in 7 items max!   After staring at him in a state of mute indecision for a few minutes (I wanted them all!), I decided on chocolate vanilla and peanut butter.  My lovely guy ran downstairs and came back with a cute little box stamped with \"Babycake cupcakes\"-perfect size for 2.  The guy who handed me my minis on a napkin in Miss Cora's should take note.  They were pricey at $7.50 (incl tax) or so for two...but not too bad for a treat!\nNot so sure about the choc-vanilla...could get a slight taste of mint from it.   Maybe it was near the mint ones?  Regardless the bun was excellent and the frosting was good.  Peanut butter chocolate was also very tasty with a lovely fresh bun-the perfect blend of soft and crumbly without a hint of dryness.  Frosting tended more to the sugary than the creamy (I like them a little more indulgent) but was good nevertheless.  They're kind of a perfect size too-not so big that eating one inflicts nausea and/or a sugar coma but not so small that you feel deprived!\nNot the absolutely best cupcakes I've had but a solid 4 star.  I'll take the hit for Yelp and keep sampling the other flavours, martyr that I am!",

The staff were super enthusiastic, really friendly and chatty.  I was generally offered a coffee when I went in and sometimes scored some yummy biscuits.\n\nI've bought countless sleeves of coffee from the boutique here.  For the first 6 months they were out of stock of the customer cards so I had to go through the laborious process of spelling out my name each time.  G, r, a...no, \"a\".  \"A\" for...am I the only one who can never think of a clean word when trying to spell things out?!?  Anyway, they eventually got some in which is a small mercy.  Staff are adequate to somewhat friendly.  I have been offered one cup of coffee here in the past 6 months.  None since.  The woman serving me the other day asked if I had tried a certain type of espresso.  I hadn't.  She didn't offer to let me.  I didn't buy it.  I've seen people drinking cups at the bar there so they must give them out.  Maybe you have to be aggressive and ask?  Maybe they don't like me?  \n\nNespresso as a brand has worked hard to create the illusion of exclusivity and a feeling of being in a special club.  At home in Ireland, this worked well.  It felt like a treat to buy.  Here, it's more like I'm being penalised for having bought the machine.  Still love the machine and the coffee though so I suppose I'll continue to drag myself in there or start paying for shipping!",

You'll be walking along Queen West, minding your own business, when you see the sign advertising mini donuts and a big arrow.  How to resist?\n\nThe café itself is small but pretty quiet.  I've had regular drip coffee a couple of times and it was good-I'm getting a bit sick of Starbucks and can barely stomach Tim Horton's coffee.\n\nThe mini donuts are adorable and delicious.  As Tammy Y said, they're $2.75 for 6 and $4 for 12.  You get a choice of icing sugar, granulated sugar or cinnamon.  I was bringing mine to a barbecue and didn't know what people would like so had a tough time deciding.  The man making them recommended cinnamon and I think he was right.  They get a big thumbs up from me!  Also got icing sugar ones which were also yum and all warm and freshly baked....\n\nThere's not a huge selection of other things to eat although the cookies do look good.  I was very impressed by the girl serving who discussed cupakes enthusiastically and gave recommendations!  More places to try :-)\n\nSo, kind of a 3 to 4....it's just a little bit small and there's not a huge selection.  Definitely try the mini donuts though.  They're mini so eating them doesn't count!",

        "text": "I've waited ages to update-just in case things changed.  Unfortunately they haven't.\nI think the same Cardio Theater sets (that allow users to listen to the TV) on the cardio machines have been broken since i joined 10 months ago.  This is despite emails and tweets to @GoodLifeListens on Twitter with promises to fix them.  It means making a beeline for the same few functional machines each time or being unable to watch TV.  I'm still getting over the fact that there are communal TVs too.  It's like I've gone back in time.  Sometimes it's just not worth trying to change to something watchable-some of the clientele have a mad stare.  I reported a broken shower in the changing room last September (10 months ago) and it too is still broken.\n\nThere has been a turnover of front desk staff since I joined so it's a mixture of a few extremely nice people and some just OK.  Sam in the mornings is a ray of sunshine though.  I just wish I didn't have to go to work at that time-I never get to see her anymore!  I'm always happy to see Mason who is absolutely lovely and Janessa who is really smiley and cheers me up when I go in.  I cross my fingers that they're working.\n\nThe trainers have changed around a bit too.  I can't afford to hire one anyway but it's interesting to see the differences in personalities and techniques.  Some never ever say hello, others are friendly and make me happy to be there.  Adam is always smiling, says hello and puts his clients through challenging but well thought-out sessions.   He teaches them well and is completely focused on them at all times. It's obvious that his clients trust and like him.  Dean gave me a complimentary introductory session which was fantastic fun and I left with new ideas after just an hour.  He was the first I saw using a TRX there.  Rey is always friendly and I had a very interesting chat with Ingrid one night.   Alex is a welcome addition and also really friendly and chatty.  They've made me feel a better about the place.  I perk up when I see them and feel like it really is my \"home\" gym.  I actually miss them when I go somewhere else for a workout.\n \nThe layout is still poor.  They've installed a multimount rack for TRX training in one of the rooms.  The TRX is great fun to use so that's good....but it adds to the space issue.   I think they needed to think more about where they were going to put everything else.  They have too many machines cluttering the  place that barely get any use and then others that people practically have to fight over.\n\nAll the dumbbells were replaced recently.  On the upside, they don't leave black marks or wobble like some of the previous ones.  The downside is that they look and feel cheap and are really bulky.   They should really have bought some hex ones when they were buying them too.  I like the graduated barbells though.\n\nThe place feels grubby and dirty.  I'm not sure how much of it is purely the decor which is firmly lodged in the 70s.  The carpet is disgusting and I've come across sticky patches-shudder.  They recently refloored the showers but didn't bother to change the stalls or curtains which could have completely lifted the look.  They could also have fixed the stupid broken shower too.  For future reference (if you are really stuck for a gym and have to go there)-it's the first one on the left.  Another peeve is that there is only one water fountain for the whole main floor and the tap to fill bottles doesn't work.\n\nOverall, when somebody asks where I go I say \"GoodLife-but because it's just around the corner\".  I'm not proud of it and I wouldn't bring a guest here.  Suppose it's not really a resounding endorsement, is it?  If it wasn't for the members of staff who are really friendly there I'd probably be somewhere else.  GoodLife are lucky that they've managed to find a group of talented and genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic people.  If they just improved the superficial stuff and maintained the facility better it could really be a joy.",

A facial at Axispa was my Fabfind find-75 mins at a discounted rate.\n\nI made my initial enquiries by email which they answered promptly, thankfully.  I hate trying to organise things by phone-I find it awkward.  They didn't have a  Saturday slot for a few weeks so I booked a 5pm appointment for today.  They phoned me when I was in work a week later saying something about a mix-up with times or something and wanting to know when I'd booked.  It didn't inspire confidence so I ended up emailing yesterday just to check that I was still booked!\n\nI was greeted warmly and given water while waiting and filling out my forms.  The reception area was clean and bright.  Was good to note that they do St Tropez tan.  It's not my favourite but will do if I can't find my other go-to tans!\n\nThe aesthetician was very sweet.  We chatted about my concerns and my (haphazard) skin routine.   She inspected my skin and decided that hydration was in order!   My skin has had a rough time with the winter.   It was an excellent facial-cleasing, bit of gentle scrubbing, steam, extractions, masks and some kind of device that she ran over my skin.  Instead of doing what many do where they run out while the mask is on, she did hand and arm, scalp and neck massages.  I was only left there twiddling my thumbs for about 5 mins!\n\nIt lasted about 60 mins total-I wonder if the 75 mins incorporates a bit of chilling out time afterwards?  I found the room a bit chilly but it was spotless and exactly like the pictures associated with the Yelp listing.  I was nosing around while getting ready and was impressed by how well maintained everything was-even the wax pot looked perfect.\n\nThere was no hard sell of products-just suggestions and some general recommendations.  I must definitely try to save my pennies so I can go back.  I've spent the evening stroking my face, murmuring \"mmm, silky smooth...\".  I think I'm worth it!",

It's a chore, it's expensive, they keep trying to make my hair shorter, they try to sell me more shampoo and scold me for doing my own colour. Then to add insult to injury they ask if I'm going anywhere for my holidays and remind me that I'm not because I'm poor. Not this time though!\n\nI got a great TeamBuy deal for a wash, cut and style at Powder. I felt a bit nervous buying, to be honest, because the business is new and there weren't really any reviews to go on at the time. They had a Facebook page though and seemed friendly so I took a chance. The gamble paid off, as it turns out.\n\nFirst point in their favour? I was able to make my appointment by email. Responses were quick and there was no problem getting an appointment for 5pm on Saturday. I love that efficiency. The owner, Rafael, said he'd take me himself.\n\nI arrived just before 5pm and was greeted warmly. The salon is gorgeous: spotless, high ceilings and kind of a French retro style with black, white and red topped off with chandeliers. Everything was very tidy and the whole atmosphere was relaxed.\n\nWe started with the consultation. Rafael really made an effort to understand what I wanted and how I style my hair (basically I don't) day to day. Then it was off for a wash from the lovely Peyton, complete with scalp massage and then back for the cut. I was not asked about vacations. Yes!! The conversation was interesting but not overwhelming. He cuts as if he has been doing it all his life and checked the length with me before he chopped. It feels short now...but what he took off needed to go, realistically.\n\nThe blow dry was great. Lovely waves and very gentle. I think I nodded off at one stage. I loved the result and he actually sat me down to give me a quick tutorial on how to get the effect with my flat iron at home! Zero products pushed which was wonderful.\n\nI really cannot fault the experience. Sometimes salons make you feel like you're just not cool enough to be there. This was the opposite. I left feeling more like I'd been to some kind of spiritual retreat. There's a genuine friendliness and gentleness about the place that I don't think I've experienced before. Rafael is like you'd want your GP to be-he cares and listens. Peyton was an absolute pleasure. And my hair? Exactly how I wanted it.",

And have done.  I could practically feel the plaque tracking across my teeth as I ate it.  I ended up dumping it.\n-Nutella: frosting was OK but I could definitely feel the little grains of sugar in it.  Cake suffered the same fate as the salted caramel and was doughy.\n\nThe two cakes I bought today were $6.78 after tax which was a bit pricey for the size.\n\nAll in all, there are better places.

It has a clean, modern look and loved the chandeliers!\n\nService was a bit inattentive and they were very slow to serve us. This may have been due to it being very busy that afternoon, and they were pleasant when they did come to our table-but it did detract from the experience.\n\nThe afternoon tea itself was really impressive, however! The tea was good and they topped up the pot with hot water frequently. It's not just boring sandwiches either-we had spring rolls with dipping sauce, cheese and pear tartlets, mushroom strudel and shrimp crostini. All were really good. Scones were served with jam, fruit curd and whipped cream and were light and fluffy. Pastries were macarons, lemon and chocolate tarts and a black sesame cake. The cake was my least favourite-but I think that's because of my unsophisticated tastes! They also had no problem packing up some of the remainders to take home.\n\nWe left full and very happy. The time just flew! We're planning on going back after spending much of our time staring at the group next to us who had the most delicious looking mountain of meat.

He got to choose the food and was craving burgers so we ended up here. \nHe'd been out the night before so our \"lunch\" was late-around 4.30pm-and the place was deserted. This was pleasant for us really and hardly surprising considering it was only lunchtime Pacific time. There was one poor unfortunate guy serving who was stuck with serving and cooking. He was pleasant though and got going with our burgers after serving us our drinks. We both ended up with classic burgers which were delicious! The burger was just the right size for me and the bun was fresh and fluffy. There were a few different choices of burgers which I'd like to try at some stage and there is also the option to make a custom one using a variety of toppings. They have a choice of soft drinks and beer. The birthday boy was more than happy with his choice of pint!\nSeating is in booths or on stools. We choose a booth and were comfy and cosy. Service was pretty friendly but not overbearing. This turned out to be a good thing when the birthday candle I stuck in my friend's birthday brownie lit the pink tissue I'd used to wrap it and we ended up with a minor fire. Our cook/server was oblivious to that little incident. Phew!\nI also got away with buying a very cheap birthday lunch. Classic burgers are $5.95 each and we were both happy with our meal.

Next appointment another 3 weeks away.  I didn't bother.\n\nI understand that I was late.  That's my fault.  I'd hate somebody else to be delayed because of that.  I also understand that the healthcare system is overloaded.  However, I think 10 minutes for a first appointment is inappropriate.  I simply don't think it's enough time to take a full history and perform a detailed examination.

Someone will come to my home and stamp/notarize my stuff for the same price as trekking into an office? And do that on evenings, weekends and holidays too? There must be a catch. I decided to test it out and see though-considering the other notary services in town that only open weekdays meant I'd have to wait weeks to get my work done.\n\nAs it turns out, there's no catch. Vinh Tran is working independently as a lawyer in Chinatown and also provides this super affordable and convenient notary service. It's even cheaper if you can make it to certain downtown locations on a Monday, Wednesday or Friday during the day-$15 for the 1st document! I still think I got a bargain with my house call. There was no travel fee because I'm within 2km of the base office at Dragon City Mall and my fee was $40. For that I could get 2 documents notarized. If you live further away, there's a comprehensive list of locations and times on the website: http://www.housecallnotary.ca/index.php?p=1_2_NOTARY-FEES\n\nThe process itself was just fantastic. Vinh is easily contactable by text or email (he's a man after my own heart-don't call him!) and there was no problem organising an appointment for Sunday evening when I texted on Sunday afternoon. He was on time/early and extremely professional. He's also pleasant, genuine and approachable. I can't really think of a downside to this. Price comparable to other services, outside of normal business hours and I didn't have to step foot outside my building. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend!",

I had the half Cornish hen which was served with cauliflower and spinach.  It basically tasted like chicken in gravy with a measly portion of veg.  I was still hungry after it and it was not in any way special.   The friend across from me got butternut squash pizza which was tasty but cold.  The still lovely staff presented the birthday girl with a chocolate mousse thing as a cake substitute at the end which was OK.  The desserts in general were underwhelming.  In general people I talked to afterwards were not impressed and thought it was overpriced with mediocre food.  I don't know if some of this relates to Rob Rossi's departure as executive chef, but I think it will be reserved for wine and cheese nights for me from now on.",

They also do sandwiches so that you can have something more substantial to get you through the day.  Location is good-it's in the food court at Toronto General Hospital.  \nIn theory, this would be perfect.  It's handy for me when I'm at work, they have a range of soups which should fill the gap on a wintry day.  The staff are very friendly.  Unfortunately, they fail on one pretty important thing-the soup.  I've tried the chili, the veggie chili and the chicken noodle.  Both the chilis were pretty tasteless.  Warm and filling, but didn't really taste much like chili.  The chicken noodle smelled a bit funny, had oily spots on the surface and didn't taste particularly nice.  Like salty hot water with an aftertaste of something unidentifiable...but not chicken!\nI may try some of the other varieties so that I can update the review, but for now it will be relegated to days when I really need soup-like if the dentist tells me I can't have solids and I forget to bring food from home!",

Importantly, it's also cheap!\n\nGreat breads and fresh chewy bagels with a large selection of croissants/chocolate croissants etc.  You get the best selection if you get there early-including my downfall: the cinnamon crunchies.  $1.25 buys you a buttery, sugary cinnamon bun which is utterly addictive.  I've never managed to get it home without attacking it out of the bag en route.  Tip: they keep them in the same cabinet as the croissants etc over on the right.\n\nThe refrigerated display houses various little slices and cakes.  They're all really competitively priced-most in the $1-2 range.  Sadly, their cupcakes didn't impress and I haven't bought them again.  The Naimo bar was tasty though.\n\nService is usually efficient and sometimes even with a smile.\n\nLove this place as an antidote to the overpriced and/or mass produced stuff in bakeries elsewhere.

I remembered the delicious bakery smell though, so when the pursuit of a massage brought me to the area I made the effort not to gorge myself beforehand so that I could check this place out.\n\nIt's a small enough little shop and I actually like the decor! I found it cosy and exactly how I'd like the little cake shop I open when I win Lotto Max to look. I was kind of hoping to get a mini cupcake but they didn't have any when I arrived in at 3.40pm on a sunny Saturday afternoon. I went for a puff pastry thing filled with creme patissiere instead and a cup of coffee. Definitely not the cheapest at $3.75-the pastry was pretty small-but both the coffee and pastry were good! It was a really fresh and light puff pastry with sweet and smooth cream. The smaller size was definitely enough. They had a larger version too but I suspect even my sweet tooth might have struggled with it.\n\nEverything in the cabinet looked pretty tempting and some staff were busily decorating a cake when I went in. They handed a birthday cake over while I was there and the recipients seemed very happy with it.\n\nService was a touch on the  unenthusiastic side from the guy behind the counter. Maybe I caught him at a bad moment. It also seems to be partly staffed by children/a child. At least on the 2 occasions I've ventured in!\n\nI picked up a wifi signal but it was secured and the code didn't jump out at me on any signage from where I was sitting. I didn't look very hard though and I wasn't staying long so didn't bother asking. Maybe next time! I hate having to ask though in case it's not for guests....as has happened to me in other places.\n\nBut I will indeed try to make another trip!",

It's a great little health food store and is bustling despite being located a mere hop, skip and a jump from the larger Essence of LIfe. I still often choose Tutti Frutti over Essence of Life, though, despite it being smaller and lacking the same selection of fresh foods. It feels like my little personal store.\n\nThey have a good selection of bulk items which are competitively priced, they somehow manage to squeeze in chilled and frozen foods and they have a myriad of vitamins, herbal supplements etc. Their prices for protein powder etc are great-no need to pay over the odds if vegan protein powder is your poison of choice. They're generally cheaper than most other places for my treats like nut butters, coconut butter, goji berries, cacao nibs etc. They were a few dollars cheaper than Noah's for some of those items the last time I checked and they're often slightly cheaper than Essence of LIfe. They're also great for hard to find things like Cocovie coconut jam-my new sugar fix.\n\nThe space around the cash registers is cramped but they're actually really quick at serving everybody so you don't have much time to linger and discover that they're cheaper than pretty much anybody else if you want to buy Clif bars, Lara bars etc. I think it's generally the owners on the cash and they're very pleasant!

He kept running out at lunch to get sandwiches and also buying big containers of pasta for his dinners when he couldn't be bothered to cook. Then I started trying it for lunch and got hooked myself.\nOne of the criticisms levelled against it below is that the food tastes like something you could make at home. That's precisely its charm for me. The food tastes real and wholesome. Like the stuff I'd like to make at home-not the handfuls of M&Ms which would be more likely to exit my kitchen. The lunch menu doesn't change much and is full of sandwiches, soups, salads and various meals like lasagne etc. I've had soup which was really tasty and fresh-tasting and my other go-to is the salad with BBQ chicken. It's healthy and tasty and really not that expensive at just over $8. \nI love the ambience of the café. It's cosy and welcoming with bright colours and tables for two. Staff are not always very friendly-perhaps due to the busy service at lunchtime; however the older woman who works there (and I think cooks) is a complete sweetheart. She's like the grandmother I never had-all sweet, smiley and caring.\nSo-decent value for money, cosy and reliably tasty food. That's an excuse for ending up there every week, isn't it?",

The man in front of me had some kind of support last night but was still not happy by the time the intermission came around. I end up doing the make do approach to comfort and putting my balled up coat behind my back to make it straighter.\n\nRaymond's review and his $149 ticket price reminded me that I should have mentioned the TSO programme for 35 and under: tsoundcheck. If you buy a subscription package ahead of time, it's $90 for 3 concerts and you get to choose good seats-including in his preferred section! I've been up close and personal with Itzhak Perlman this season for that bargain price. They release $14 tsoundcheck tickets closer to the concert. You might not get as nice a seat...but it's still hard to pass up. I agree that C1 is my preferred section too. I was in row 0 last night and liked it both for view and acoustics. They were right when they told Raymond that C3 is prime seating. It is what they consider the best! Front centre mezzanine is always priced highest. Not my personal preference though so worth looking at the seating map if you're booking and prefer to be closer: http://www.roythomson.com/rth_seatingplans\n\nI'll leave my thoughts on the orchestra and Peter Oundjian for my TSO review.",

There was a queue to get in but it moved fairly rapidly.  Once we got through the entrance, it was clear that this restaurant was perfect for our type of group.   Staff were very helpful and multiple high chairs were sourced.  The strollers were stored within minutes and adjoining tables found.  The older kids headed straight for the happy chaos of the play area and we went about the adventure of finding some food.\n\nLike the other reviewers have said, this is an open restaurant with multiple stalls to choose from. You get a swipe card on arrival and use it when ordering your food.  There is lots of choice-all types of hot food, salads, pastries, sushi.  It was Easter Sunday and the last day of my trip so I made a beeline for the crepe bar.  Got a really yummy banana crepe with chocolate sauce and ice-cream.  Yum!  The other meals looked very tasty too and everyone seemed happy.

Nevertheless-it's reasonably close to me, they take Passport to Prana and they have a 7.30am class on Saturdays so that I had a full day to recover.\nFirst off, it's hard to find.  I failed the first time I tried and had to go back to the map.  The second time I planned on going I arrived after they had locked the door so had to trudge away, mat in hand.  Third time lucky though-got in and got through the door.  Woo!  The building really doesn't inspire confidence.  The staircase is all dark and brown-kind of public library circa 1984.  The reception area when you actually get there is surprisingly bright and airy though and my welcome was warm.  They have a place for shoes, mats for hire, some athletic detergent (I now know why) and a big reception desk.\nMy instructor for the day was Richard and he checked me in, got me to fill out the usual health form/waiver and gave me a quick introduction.  He made a big effort to learn my awkward name which I really appreciated.  He directed me to the changing rooms at the back.\n\nChanging rooms were past the washing machine and fine.  Clean with filtered water, 3 showers, 2 toilets and some shelves.  No lockers.  The outside door is locked once the class starts and I really wasn't happy leaving my wallet and ipod unattended so I brought them into the room.  I was told not to the next time....so probably best to bring no valuables.\n\nThe 7.30am class was pretty quiet.  I didn't know where the instructor would be so accidentally ended up in the front row.  The studio is bright and quite open....but more school hall than tranquil oasis.  Probably what Bikram would like though.  Richard was lovely and gave good instructions but it took a while to become accustomed to having no demonstrations and no adjustments.  I did a bit of reading later and learned a bit about Bikram's \"dialogue\"-all the things the instructor says to talk you through the class.   The main aim for me was staying in the room apparently.  Not an easy task.  It was boiling!  Worse was the fact that most of the heat was coming from the floor so that the mat work, usually the nice bit of a yoga class, was the hardest for me.  I was glad that I managed NOT to vomit.  Water breaks are strictly monitored-only between poses.  This was hard at that time in the morning.  Think I'd probably have to hook myself up to a litre of fluids overnight to be adequately hydrated on arrival!\n\nRichard won a place in my heart for his friendly smile, sense of humour...and for leading a round of applause for me at the end....because I survived :-)\n\nWould I go back?  Possibly.  I'd be more inclined if they had a special on their packages-currently they're on the pricey end.  Intro week is $27 for unlimited classes.  Other prices are:\nSingle Class .... $22\n10 classes for $170 (6-month expiry)\n20 classes for $270 (6-month expiry)\n\nUnlimited Passes\n1 month for $175\n3 months for $430\n6 months for $800\n1 Year for $1400",

I didn't get around to actually visiting until a couple of friends suggesting going to a show for New Year's Eve.  We've tired of clubs, lots of people we know were out of town...and we decided we couldn't sit in drinking tea every single year.\nI dawdled when it came to booking my ticket because I was waiting to hear from one other friend.  When I checked online a couple of days beforehand it was sold out!  I was so disappointed.  Luckily a friend suggested that they sometimes have extra tickets if you call the box office.  I called in the next day and, sure enough, they were able to release a ticket.  Success!  The tickets were NYE-expensive ($55 + tax) but everywhere is a rip-off that night.\nIt's recommended that you turn up 45 minutes before the show to get the best seats.  We didn't so we ended up on the balcony.  The downside is that you're a bit further from the stage.  The upside is that there is no chance of being engaged in audience participation but you still have a great view.\nWe had one terse server but the others were very pleasant.  Wine was reasonable-both quality and price.  We were surprised at the great value for the long island iced tea...until we tasted it.   It was only good value if it actually contained alcohol.  This was so watered down it tasted like diluted Pepsi.  Expensive for that!  The snacky food they served looked fine but we didn't order.\nWe really enjoyed the show-Dreams Really Do Come True....   Some kind of funny sketches and some hilarious.  The cast are mostly excellent.  They're so energetic and enthusiastic!  There was some audience participation for the \"lucky\" people at the front but they were never mean to them.  I wanted to go again at the end...and was strongly considering taking an improv class.\nThe cast came back on stage for the countdown and we'd all been given champagne, hats and bugles.  I finished 2011 and entered 2012 with great friends, having laughed for 2 hours and with vague plans to try an new fun hobby.  Happy!",

He looked at me like I was demented when I tried to explain so I just trailed off and mumbled something about \"bit obsessed...\".  Bought vanilla and chocolate again.  He helpfully placed them in a napkin so that the frosting got smashed into it.  Vanilla definitely not nice.  Too much extract in the frosting (which was hard) and a rock hard bun.  Probably partly because it came from the fridge.  On second tasting, the chocolate one is only OK.  Frosting pretty much exactly like the Betty Crocker one.  \nAt $1.50 per mini they shouldn't be just acceptable....they should be practically gourmet and consistently good.   I'm not overwhelmed.  This is probably a good thing considering the proximity to my condo and my too tight clothing!",

        "text": "I didn't know how to rate this place really.  I think if I could afford to live in the area and was earning millions, it might seem like a reasonable place to shop.  I'm not sure I could stomach the prices even then though, having spent my life to this point living in the real world.  \n\nI've been grumbling about the lack of Fage Greek yogurt here since I moved over 11 months ago.  An ancient thread on Chowhound suggested that there might be some at Summerhill Market.  I had time to kill so pottered along for a look around.  I was delighted to see that they had it in various sizes, flavoured and plain, 0% fat and 2%.  The unfortunate thing was that I absolutely couldn't bring myself to pay the outrageous price they were charging.  A small pot at home cost €1.  Here, it's $2.99.  The large (500g) pot is priced at a whopping $8.99.  Unless they've hidden the winning lotto max ticket in it to justify that price, it's daylight robbery.  I suggest trying the President's Choice version for $3.99 which is the closest I've found to it in taste.  Liberté and Oikos are fine if you prefer it tart.\n\nThere is a nice meat section with some lovely looking cuts of steak/lamb etc.  Yes, you would probably have to sell a kidney to buy one of theirs, but I'm sure it would taste good.  There was a decent selection of cheese and some yummy looking but rather expensive cakes.\n\nThey have a good selection of prepared meals.  I hear their chicken pot pie is exceptionally tasty.  My friend in work loves it-she just doesn't love the guilt that comes with having spent so much on something she could make herself.\n\nThey had some randomly interesting things like the Clif bar \"variations\"-the Z bars for kids (which are smaller and handier) and a large selection of the Mojo and Builder bars.  They also had a big selection of Think Thin bars too which are difficult to find elsewhere.  I keep trying them thinking I'm going to like them and find one that doesn't taste of protein powder.  Someday I'll succeed.\n\nDid a quick price check on cottage cheese to give myself some idea of their pricing.  Nordica was $4.49.  I think it's about $2.69 in No Frills at the moment.  Longos have been hovering around $3.20-$3.49.  \"Good for you\" banana bread was $7.99 vs $4.99 in Longos.  That's some mark-up!\n\nI felt better about the Fage disappointment after I'd devoured their samples.  The salty crackery thing and the pound cakey thing were delicious.  They just about revived me after the shock of the prices....",

I Googled around and eventually settled on Queen Tours because they said they'd collect from my downtown condo building-most of the other tours went from Yonge and Dundas square or hotels.\n\nI booked the evening before by phone which took all of 2 minutes. They said they'd collect us at 8.15am the following morning outside my building and they were bang on time. From the minute we got on the bus, we knew we were going to have a good day. Our driver/guide (Nathan) was so cheerful and friendly! Everybody was greeted with a smile.\n\nI had brought a book but barely got to read it on the way there. Our driver narrated so that what could have been a very boring stretch of road became interesting. He had details about the history of Toronto and Canada, views on global warming and tips on where to eat at the falls. We laughed and learned so the time flew by.\n\nWe were dropped at the Canadian Falls first and got plenty of time to have a look around, take photos, get coffee etc. We were then brought to the Maid of the Mist which was included in the price of the trip (or you could have gone up the Skylon Tower). We had exactly the right amount of time to do the boat trip and eat before it was back on the bus. We stopped at the whirlpool on the way to Niagara on the Lake. Off the bus again for an hour in NOTL and then back on and a stop at a winery where we got to sample 3 wines.\n\nWe all jumped back on the bus happily and may have napped on the way back to Toronto. We were deposited at Yonge and Dundas square at 5pm, very happy after a productive day!\n\nWe all loved Nathan, the tour guide, and everybody was really well looked after. The narration was entertaining and he really seemed to want us to enjoy the trip. Everybody seemed happy-from the young couple there with her parents to the grandmother who tagged along. I was especially grateful for the condo pickup. Price was decent at $70 + tax/person.\n\n[-0.5 stars because we were in a small bus which was a bit bumpy. My dad whining about that detracted from the day!]",

The staff are mostly pleasant and they have some decent looking muffins, croissants etc.  Nothing that I'd absolutely have to have-unusual for a carb craver such as me.  Probably a good thing overall considering my expanding waistline.\nBig/huge downside is the seating situation.  People sit on laptops treating the place like their office while I circuit the 2 seating areas, pouting and trying not to scald myself. It's a pity that it puts me off going because it's not really Dark Horse's fault. It's a great place for a chat if you do find a seat so it's still worth a try!",

Luckily, they don't expire, so maybe any rush to use the services had abated by the time I got around to booking them. \n\nThey actually answered emails which is a major point in their favour with me, and something I've found is far from a given. They allowed me to book that way too which was very much appreciated. They even gave me a cancellation the same week which was fantastic-I was going away on vacation and wanted to treat myself to getting the place cleaned!\n\nThey send a pretty extensive list of cleaning materials you'll need but seem flexible enough regarding actual versions so I didn't have to buy anything in the end except rubber gloves. \n\nMy appointment was for 1pm on Saturday. I was a little surprised to arrive back to my building at 12.45pm to find the cleaner there and 16 missed calls on my phone. I suppose it's nice that she wasn't late-but I don't have the psychic abilities to predict that she'll be 30 minutes early and arrange my day accordingly.\n\nAnyway, the cleaner herself was very friendly and got to work after a quick tour. Any tour of a one bed apartment can't really take long. I went off to do errands and left her to it. I arrived back after 3 hours and 5 minutes and she was relaxing on the couch waiting for me. She wasn't particularly phased that I was 5 minutes late which was nice.\n\nAs for the cleaning? It was pretty good. She did things I avoid-like scrubbing behind the toilet and cleaning inside the windows. She didn't clean inside the fridge or oven, she didn't clean under the microwave and don't think she dusted in my bedroom. She definitely didn't do anything like changing the bed linen. She didn't put stuff back where she found it so I had to rearrange when I got back. I actually think she was taking it upon herself to redecorate!\n\nAll in all it was good. Hopefully there would be a more thorough cleaning if the cleaner was coming every single week. I think you could probably do more in 3 hours when there are only 3 rooms. Have to say that the staff were all very helpful and pleasant though and the experience in general was thankfully unlike the other reviews!",

Their Americanos are pricey but they're real coffee with a gorgeous crema and taste silky smooth.  Mmmm.  I don't think my budget would quite cope with it being my main coffee place anyway so it's probably a good thing that I'm only in the area infrequently.\n\nStaff are friendly but service isn't super speedy.  I forgive them for taking their time though when I taste my creamy coffee.  \n\nThere's a selection of wraps, paninis and some cookies and pastries.  The selection isn't huge but it always looks fresh and tasty.  Prices are quite high though and they have a strange odd number pricing system where, for example, a cupcake costs $3.57.  Trying to figure out what combination of things could make my total an even number is the stuff of sleepless nights.\n\nI like the decor which makes a small space seem open and is bright and clean.  It hasn't been too packed any lunchtime when I've wandered in.  Maybe people were doing as I did and heading outside to enjoy the sunshine.  It's unfortunate that the closest green area is outside the Metropolitan United Church.   It's one of those park areas where I begin to doubt the appropriateness of my shoe choice.  A sudden sprint is definitely a possibility there-either away from a knife or after your handbag.\n\nFor friendly service and genuinely good coffee though, cross the road and pop into B!",

Because I'm pretty sure they have it. It can appear a bit higgledy piggledy but I think that's mainly because there is just so much of everything in a reasonably small underground space. Nuts, chocolates, dried fruit, flours, spices, sugars, biscotti, sweets and on and on and on. There's a massive selection of oils, nut butters, honeys and sauces. I'm always convinced I'm going to embark on an exotic cooking spree when I shop here. But then I end up just buying nuts and chocolate. In fact, I've had to limit my visits because the temptations around every corner are just too much to handle.\n\nIf there are downsides, it's that the place is a little cramped and can become packed so that it's difficult to pass people on the aisles. For all the hordes of shoppers though, the lines to pay are never that long. Prices are moderate-not really a bargain but they'll often match Bulk Barn. The staff are pleasant despite the place being hectic at times and they are like bizarre bulk food geniuses (genii?). They know the price of EVERYTHING. I'd like to figure out how many individual bulk food items are in that place, but I tend to lose focus when I get over 20 (high reps in the gym are troublesome) so I'll just say that there are lots of things so they are truly amazing for keeping track.\n\nSo go! And please buy all the mini peanut butter cups. And the Lindt wafers in milk, dark and white chocolate. They're temptation I don't need...",

I was on the verge of giving up on it and just buying whatever new shiny thing Apple decided to launch when I remembered how broke I am.  I decided to see if it was easily fixed.\n\nThere was nobody waiting when I went in and the friendly girl on the desk brought it straight through to the tech.  She said it would be about 10 mins and that I could wait if I wanted.  I decided to visit the Starbucks down the street and came back a few minutes later.  By that time the place had filled up with a few more people with various iPhone and iPod woes-cracked screens, failing batteries, worn out hard drives.... all of whom were given honest answers by the tech about whether or not he could fix the issue and how much it would be.  If he wasn't sure what was going on he offered diagnostics-for free.\n\nMy ipod ended up needing a battery too but they did everything for an incredibly reasonable price for me and it's now working like a dream.  The repair is also guaranteed for 6 months.  I saved myself from buying yet another ipod and it was all done in around 20 mins.  I walked out the door texting my friends to tell them where to go.  I would certainly return in the (entirely likely) event of another ipod mishap!",

I've seen her in action at that and she was full of enthusiasm!\n\nThe cupcakes seem to be mainly their 3D cupcakes-bun+frosting+filling.  They're very tasty and I love the flavours she has chosen but I do kind of wish there were more 2D cupcakes.  Sometimes all you want is a simple cupcake done really really well.  I'll have to go back and try more of them to give a full assessment.  I really enjoyed my PB & C cupcake.  I'm not quite so sure about the chocolate ganache filling in the red velvet.  I rarely turn down chocolate, but there's something lovely and fresh about red velvet when it's not messed with and it's what I'd prefer.\n\nMy biggest test was ordering 24 mini cupcakes for a baby shower.  I initially asked a few questions by email and Genevieve was quick to answer.  We sorted out the final order by phone.  She was very obliging, and in the end I decided on a mix of chocolate, vanilla and red velvet buns with pink and blue frosting.  I had 3D decorations on just 6 of them because I was on a bit of a budget!  The minis were $1.45 each and I think it was $3.45 each for the 3D decorations.  Total came to around $45.  I asked to collect them on Saturday and they were ready and waiting when I got there.  The frosting on each was perfect and they were exactly as described.  We all loved the fondant decorations-including the 1 year old guest at the shower who thought one of the pacifiers was real and whipped it from the top of a cupcake before running off with it.

It's one of those Chinatown-type places where the walls don't go all the way to the ceiling so you can hear what's happening in the other rooms. That didn't really bother me once I'd figured out that the weird banging noise was my neighbour's massage! Piped in music was the usual pan pipes stuff.\n\nMy own treatment started with 5 mins of soaking in a warm herbal bath followed by the treatment itself. My therapist massaged my shins and calves as well as my feet. No idea if she was doing anything that was actually reflexology and she definitely didn't ask about any medical problems (language barrier) but it was relaxing and neither too rough nor tickly. I actually don't particularly enjoy people touching my feet (the sole scrubbing bit of a pedicure is torture!) but was perfectly happy to have her work away and would definitely go back for a longer treatment. It finished with some warm towels and a bit more work on both legs and I was good to go. No skimping on time, either.\n\nParticularly impressed by how clean and sparkly everything was. Not what I expected!\n\nService was very friendly. You don't really need to have long conversations anyway so the language issue isn't a problem.

I love it when companies are contactable by email and they are super quick to respond. Booking an appointment was simple and they managed to get me in on a Sunday at a time that suited me. I love it that booking a massage to relieve stress was so stress free!\n\nI know people have mentioned it being above a restaurant and I did notice the aroma of food as I walked in the door downstairs but didn't notice that at all by the time I got upstairs to Bodyworks. There's a small waiting area which is cosy with hooks for coats etc and a reception desk. I was greeted warmly and wasn't waiting to be brought into the treatment room. The room itself was bright and clean. I also found it pretty quiet despite facing onto the street.\n\nMy therapist was Ada and we did the usual intake form and had a chat about all my aches and pains before she got to work. I had only booked a one hour massage and that might have been a bit too short. She spent a long time on my legs so I probably didn't have as much time as needed on my neck and shoulders. I think that was more because my legs really needed work than a criticism of the massage. In retrospect a longer massage might have been better when I had so many problem areas! Ada is tiny but managed to get out lots of the knots and was really knowledgeable as well as friendly and sweet. \n\nPayment was easy-card or cash and you get an RMT receipt for insurance claims. It's a little steep at $85 for 60 minutes; but it's hard to find a good massage cheaper than that anyway. Everyone I encountered was professional, friendly and seemed to be enthusiastic about actually helping people. If I wasn't flat broke I'd be there every week!",

I usually leave my dentist with a (lopsided) smile but I've been known to burst into tears after bad haircuts and one stylist offered me wine or Valium when I was staring at him in terror.\n\nAfter procrastinating for months, it was time to get a cut. It's not like I really decided; a colleague just looked at me in work and stated \"you really need to get your hair cut. Your split ends are terrible\". Indeed, it's all puppies and rainbows in my place of work! She was right though, so I turned to Yelp and picked Parlour.\n\nBooking was great, despite the online booking system not working. I emailed and Sarah suggested Jay for my long hair and scissors phobia. She booked me in for Saturday afternoon. I adore email and online bookings. Not only do I not have to duck out of my office to book; but I also have a record of what time I chose!\n\nMy welcome was friendly when I arrived and I was directed to the couch to wait. I didn't find the place pretentious really, but I can be pretty oblivious. The decor is fine-nothing spectacular. Jay was on time and was sweet and soft-spoken. He decided to wash, dry and iron my hair before cutting it. Apparently this makes it easier to see the ends? Anyway, he did a competent wash and dry before ironing it and giving me the verdict. The amount he planned on taking off wasn't too much so I was happy. The unusual thing was that he stuck to it. I've had innumerable cuts where an inch means four, but he really didn't lie and I pretty much kept my length. The only difference is that I no longer look quite so feral.\n\nHe was friendly and pretty chatty, as was the colourist (Mark?) who also chatted to us. I wish I had kept the magazine I picked up while I was waiting or had taken my book out of my bag though. I wasn't offered anything else to read and I don't particularly relish staring at my own face talking and scrunching for an hour. They also don't seem to offer anything to drink which is a bit mean. I was thirsty by the time I left and hadn't been offered so much as tap water. It's amazing how much the little things matter.\n\nThe bill was $68 tax in which was pretty good. I felt intensely awkward paying though. Jay said he'd walk me out and gave me a card. Then he waited while I paid and just stood there. I suppose this was to get his tip? I was going to tip anyway, but I'd prefer to have just put it in an envelope or something. Again, a small thing that I'd do differently.\n\nAll in all, a decent 3.5-4 star rating. The hair looks fine after my own attempts at styling. Am I a loyal fan though? We'll see... Dentist (Bite Dental-http://www.yelp.com/biz/bite-toronto-2) still wins I think. He has TV to entertain me, is just as fun to chat to and I get a free goody bag twice a year!\n\n****Edited to add: Tyler the owner contacted me to let me know coffee is available if you ask for it. While it's good to know, I responded that I don't usually visit people's houses and demand they make me things. I'll accept a drink if offered. Tabatha Coffey of Tabatha's Salon Takeover thinks clients should be offered a beverage too. It's not just me!******",

I did my best to resist trying any but happened to wander in one day and was just about to escape after looking in the cabinet when the assistant asked if he could help me. Foiled! I had to buy one-it was the polite thing to do.\n\nI went for the doughnut of the month which was nanaimo for September. It was really good! I love the old-fashioned jam doughnuts and cake doughnuts mostly. This was neither. What is was though, was incredibly fresh, light and fluffly. The chocolate ganache was delicious and it was topped with some creamy coconutty stuff to fit the nanaimo description. All very tasty. \n\nIt's definitely pricey but I like the size of the \"mini\" ones. They're not very  mini really. The store is clean and the staff were pleasant. It was pretty quiet on a Saturday afternoon. I hope this doesn't mean that they're not doing well. Think I'll pop back to try some more. And possibly eat the pink M&Ms on the counter.",

        "text": "First trip to a Chipotle ever. The excitement! I scoped out the menu beforehand to prepare myself. That didn't take too long since it's pretty simple-burritos, burrito bowls or salad. You line up and it's assembled in front of you assembly line style. There aren't a ton of options-rice, meats (steak (2 types), carnitas (pork) and chicken), some vegetables, beans, rice and toppings like salsa, guacamole and sour cream.\n\nThe restaurant is shiny and open with benches and stools. It's not really set up for a leisurely meal. The people taking orders seemed to be more accustomed to people getting stuff to take away too. I went with salad to save the 290 calories of the tortilla and my friend is on a paleo kick so wanted a kind of salad bowl without the lettuce but with extra meat and guacamole. I thought the server's head might explode from being asked to deviate from the strict set menu but she kind of managed. They were reasonably quick and not unfriendly, although I can't say I felt like they were thrilled to see me!\n\nWe ended up with 2 salad bowls-his with guacamole and we decided on tap water to drink for a total of $24. Gulp. These were not huge meals, by the way. They were moderate sized and served in cardboard containers. We were given cups for our water and waved over to the self serve drinks machine area. Between the 2 of us, we absolutely could not figure out where the water was and had to go back to ask. In case you'd like some, it's the teeny tiny silver button just over the Nestea one. It would have been easier to steal some Diet Coke really.\n\nAs for the food? It was tasty! I liked my pork and his steak and guacamole looked good too. I think the prices are a bit steep though and it felt quite fast food-y for that. Also-no debit! Bring your credit card or (plenty of) cash.",

I love it here!  The blurb says that the design is based on Bach's Suite No. 1 in G Major for unaccompanied cello and the map divides it into allemande, prelude, courante, sarabande, gigue and menuett.  I love walking around the swirling pathways-they remind me of treble and bass clefs.  The walk is fragrant from all the trees and flowers and it's amazingly peaceful there for a garden right on the Harbourfront.  I haven't managed to catch any live music there yet-it's my project for the summer.  I love it that summer allows me to count that as a \"project\"!\nTruly an oasis in the downtown core and one of my favourite places in the city.  Stay away so it doesn't get too busy!",

        "text": "My usual GoodLife on McCaul got flooded so I was forced to walk more than 4 minutes from my home to get a workout and decided to give Union Station a go. I'd like to point out that I had nothing whatsoever to do with the McCaul flood-despite telling anyone that would listen that the place was filthy and needed a good clean.\n\nUnion Station was formerly a platinum (fancy, more expensive) club in the chain but they abolished that whole concept so now it's accessible to the normal scum of the earth GoodLife member like me.\n\nIt's a pretty large club with the extras like a chiropractor etc. There is a nice selection of cardio machines-a mixture of Precor, Life Fitness and Cybex arc trainers mainly with a few stepmills. You might find your cardio a bit more boring than it has to be though. In usual cheap and backwards GL fashion, there are no individual TVs-just a few on the wall in front. They're set to sports, news, soaps/talk and the pointless GoodLife propaganda channel.\n\nThe weights section is large and pretty well stocked. I wish they had more free spots to do a workout though. It's a bit cramped and crowded with machines. The only decent patch of free floor space is in the personal training section which is behind barriers to keep the riff raff out. The barriers also prevent you from getting at kettlebells and the TRX frame. Not that the space is enough for the trainers. They're everywhere! They seem to be a mixed bunch. Some are Crossfitters and you'll see kipping pushups mixed with power cleans when they're with their clients. Others try to incorporate kettlebells and some seem to try a more individualised approach. One likes to sit down on the equipment-the steps, benches, massage chairs. He must be very tired. None are as friendly as the McCaul crowd.\n\nChanging rooms are clean! It's such a novelty. Plenty of lockers too. I like it that they make some attempt to raise themselves above the No Frills of gyms by providing some hair styling products and cotton buds in the changing rooms. That's super fancy for GoodLife. \n\nThis location also has a good range of classes and the studio is big and bright. I may even be tempted to take one here!\n\nAll in all; I quite like it!",

The rest of the store is the usual mixture of hair/skin/personal care and random things like cards, seasonal and cleaning products.  It's pleasant wandering around because it's so sparkling clean and bright.

Hurrah!  So, did the sheen wear off Bite after the first few sessions? I think that's a resounding NO. I'm so depressed to be saying goodbye and the thought of trying to find a new dentist and practice to match Dr Rose and his team is almost overwhelming!\n\nThe receptionists are always smiling, the practice is spotless, the hygienists don't leave so much as a molecule of plaque behind, they will always squeeze you in if you need to be seen and the hours are fantastic for someone who works.\n\nDr Rose took my mouth from constant emergencies and disasters to pretty stable. My mother, who told me that I really should stop spending time and money on my teeth and just get false ones instead, looked at me recently and told me that my teeth were lovely. Amazing!\n\nAll this is wrapped up in a calm and friendly environment. It's lovely to feel like you have a say and you're part of the team looking after your teeth. Dr Rose gives options, doesn't upsell and had the patience of a saint. My most nervous friend wondered why she'd put off going to the dentist for so long after visiting. As for me, I've actually wondered just how feasible it would be to win the lottery and fly over biannually for my check-up and work. Crazy! \n\nBut don't take my word for it. Go and check them out. He's fantastic but so is Dr Yeow and the newer members of the team were chosen because they have the same standards and attitude. You might find your own favourite! Only downside? Leaving is a sweet, sweet sorrow. (Seriously. Sounds weird but very true)",

The things I put myself through for Yelp!\n\nMy friend Susan and I were going to a work party that started at 7.30pm.  I'm not sure exactly what time we eventually tottered up to the door-maybe 8.30pm.  It had taken me way too long to do my hair and she had a wardrobe emergency.  I also still have a tendency to work on \"Irish time\" where 7.30pm means 9pm at the earliest.  Anyway, we entered and asked the maitre d where to go.  He beamed and started to lead us in the right direction-but also managed to tell us we were late in a semi-scolding manner.  I think he may have been joking?\n\nThe function room upstairs is medium-sized and airy.  Smiling staff came through offering hors d'oeuvres.  I wasn't that hungry but they were so friendly that it seemed rude to refuse.  They were very tasty!  I particularly liked the duck and pear.  Mmmm.  The bar staff were similarly lovely and incredibly patient with a crowd that rapidly became rather tipsy thanks to drinks vouchers.  They managed to keep beaming. I maintain that they were generous with their pours too.  I need to explain my dancing later in the night somehow! .\n\nA nice plus was the huge TV on the wall which was set up for presentations-we got to see a movie that had been put together for the occasion.  The bathrooms were spotless and seemed to be only for the room.  There were no lines!\n\nBased on this experience I will definitely be back to have a sit-down meal.  I'll be on time though!",

I've a terrible tendency to go in for a pack of Band-Aids and end up spending $100 on conditioner and face cream.  I sometimes think my life could be improved by getting the lifestyle experts from Slice to come live with me-mainly Gail Vaz-Oxlade and Paul Plakas/Tommy Europe.\n\nAs Vivek mentioned, they've installed an annoying swing gate on the right as you enter.  It's possible to squeeze along the side of it and continue to go right, but I'm reluctant to do that with security watching.  Instead I now have to avert my eyes as I cut through the extensive budget-ruining Beauty Boutique.  They have a great range of skin care from Dermaglow/Vichy/La Roche and Neostrata.  One of my friends recommended Kinerase and I was convinced they didn't have it until I found it next to the Strivectin etc opposite the L'Oreal make-up stand.\n\nThe medicines, vitamins, hair and body care, Canada Post and house cleaning things are upstairs.  I've used the pharmacy twice and both times the pharmacist was Dean who was smiley, friendly, efficient and knowledgeable.  He's a pleasure to deal with!  I've had really pleasant experiences with the staff in the Beauty Boutique too.  Friendly and know their products without being pushy.  \n\nThe grocery section is small and overpriced but handy if you've run out.  Strangely, the milk is cheaper here than in most grocery stores (except No Frills or Chinatown) and it's worth watching out for the specials.  It was handy when I was going through my peanut butter phase and it coincided with 750g jars for $3.49.  (Not really a good thing overall unless you really want to pack on the pounds.  That stuff is the easiest way I've found to go over my calories).\n\nThere's a great selection of magazines and some books which have decent discounts.  The focus is on chick lit though.\n\n-0.5 stars for the SDM prices and the randomness of the lines-sometimes none, sometimes way back into the grocery section.

The hot weather and the lack of air conditioning in my home gym (McCaul-I swear it was hotter inside than outside) provided the perfect excuse to give this gym a trial run.\n\nIt really is lovely.  The front desk staff are friendly and the first impression is one of openness-the ceilings are high and the main floor is wide.  The locker rooms are a quick escalator ride downstairs and are very pleasant indeed-plenty of lockers, a few mirrors with areas to do make-up etc and showers.  The showers are actually clean with real doors.  I wouldn't even feel like I should probably be using antibacterial soap in them!\n\nDownstairs also houses a hot yoga studio, aerobics studio, boxing studio, massage/chiropractor clinic and the turf zone.  I loved the idea of the turf zone and it's got lots of shiny toys to play with (including ropes, kettlebells)...but only if you've hired one of their trainers.  Sigh.\n\nThe main gym floor upstairs is expansive and crammed full of machines.  They have their GoodLife Fit Fix set of machines in one corner-I wonder if anyone will use them here?   Cardio machines are plentiful and have individual TVs.  They also have a nice selection of brands-Precor and Octane ellipticals, Cybex arc trainers, Stairmaster stairmills, Life Fitness steppers, Precor AMTs, spinning bikes, exercise bikes with games, rowers, Life Fitness treadmills.  Lots and lots!  \n\nStrength-wise they have many many machines as usual.  The free weights section is rather cramped and full of benches.  I was glad to see they'd included a glute ham raise though.  That could be fun!  I also saw a rope trainer which I need to try.  There's a separate stretching area which has lots of mats and is home to the stability balls and foam rollers.  A sizeable central portion of the floor is taken up by a TRX multimount station, weights and kettlebells.  This is cordoned off for personal training only.\n\nFun extras include massage chairs and computers.  There is a large selection of trainers so I'm sure you'd find one to suit your needs if you wanted.\n\n*Positives:  Clean and spacious\n                     Lovely selection of cardio machines\n                     Fun extras like massage chairs\n                     24 hours Mon-Thurs\n\n*Negatives:  -Weights area is too cramped with very little free floor  space.  It was really difficult to find a free corner to just do my own thing.\n                      -I couldn't find a step to do step-ups so had to put my grubby shoes on a bench instead.  It would also make sense to have a selection of stability balls (especially small ones which are in short supply), medicine balls and mats in the strength/free weights section.  It's not always either/or.  I suspect things will get thrown all over the place as it is.\n                     -Much space is given over to personal training only.   I'd love to afford it and I'm sure their clients have great fun-but why take away all that floor?  And why keep it blocked off when no training sessions are happening?  They must realise that fitness is tending towards functional training, free weights etc...yet they deprive the everyday customer of it.\n                    -Despite the big 24 HOURS splashed all over the place (in lettering that is almost as tall as me on the front), it's only 24 hours Monday through Thursday.  It closes at 10pm on Friday and weekend hours are 8-8pm.  The hours are decent but not really exceptional, frankly.\n\nIn summary:\nI really liked it!  It's very very good.  I'm thinking 4.5 stars maybe.  A little tweaking could potentially bring it to 5!",

I really liked this place.\n\nThe store/café itself is gorgeous.  It's bright and white with pretty tables and chairs and a cosy couch over by one window.  There are cute touches like chandeliers and big glass containers full of meringues as decoration.  Examples of fantastically decorated occasion cakes are along one wall.  I actually think I might like to live there.\n\nThe biggest challenge was choosing what to eat.  Everything looked divine.   They had a selection of cupcakes, a big carrot cake, quiche, butter tarts, macarons and many more things I can't remember.  I was too overwhelmed by greed.  I eventually settled on a red velvet cupcake-it's a good test of a cupcakery I think-and we decided to share some macarons.  Service was extremely friendly and we settled down to our sugar fest.\n\nI loved my red velvet cupcake.  It was light and tasty with a light cream cheese frosting.  I had to restrain myself from gobbling it down.   Yum!  I tried some of the carrot cake which was delicious.   The cream cheese was feather light and incredibly creamy and the cake was spicy and flavourful.  I thought I might have to sit on my hands to stop myself from digging in and stealing it all.  Macarons were also delicious.  Sweet and chewy with recognisable flavours.  We tried hazelnut and chocolate, chocolate, vanilla and salted caramel.  The salted caramel was subtle but very tasty.  I think chocolate might have been my favourite-as usual!\n\nIf I had to nitpick, I might say that I'd have liked my coffee in a real mug instead of a paper cup and real forks instead of plastic.  It was good coffee though and crockery and cutlery are not enough to mark it down for.  It was a really cosy place to sit and I could imagine happy times sitting there with a book or just watching the world go by.  The atmosphere was so nice that we didn't notice the time go by and overstayed our welcome to past 6pm.  The girl who had served us was very sweet though and just smiled and wished us a great weekend as we left too late.  Sweet people and sweet cakes-how could I not love it?",

She has exceeded expectations!  \n\nMy initial visit with her included consultation time and she did a focused assessment to further evaluate my issue.  She was so friendly and interested.  She is fantastic for any runners who want to get back on the road-she is a former elite distance runner!  She did some soft tissue work which was weirdly perfect.  She seemed to catch every single knot and trouble spot in my neck and shoulders.  She has definitely done all this a million times before!  She then gave me a couple of stretches to do.  They're quick enough that I have no excuse not to do them but seem to be working.  \n\nWhen I went back I was already feeling better and hope to continue to improve.  I have more sessions to do and a follow-up with Dr Lum to go but feel so glad I found this place!  Everyone (from the reception staff to physios to Dr Lum) has been incredibly professional and friendly and they have managed to gain my trust and make me feel better.  Lucky find!",

        "text": "I'm going to echo Giuliana B's mixed feelings.  \nI first wandered into Parade last week after seeing some pretty dresses on the windows and big signs saying \"no HST on items over $50\".  I was greeted by a pleasant blonde girl who allowed me to browse and we chatted about a couple of the dresses.  I was wondering whether or not to go to the work Christmas party and in the \"I might go if I can find a dress\" stage.\n\nI went back this weekend to try on one of the dresses I had seen last week.  I'm still carrying more pounds than I'd like so wanted to finding something pretty inexpensive-the aim is to not need to wear it again soon.  I'd seen something that looked good last week so made a beeline for it and the assistant started me a dressing room.   There wasn't much to start since that was all I wanted to try.  The dress was fine but she kept coming back with other options-twice and three times the price.   Luckily didn't push them too hard.\n\nWhen I went to pay, I noticed that HST was added so I asked them about the signs.  She and an older one (presumed owner) referred me to the small writing at the bottom of the sign that said \"except holiday\".  I was a bit confused-what holiday?  Apparently holiday means dresses.  I think.  Despite much debate involving the owner challenging me to tell her precisely what term I'd prefer her to use, I never really found out.  I'm guessing party wear.  Which is what I suggested as a term.  She said that she's in retail so holiday is a known term.  I apologised for my lack of education and for my stupidity.  She thanked me for my input....\n\nAnyway, I vaguely noticed that the security alarms beeped when I went into Zellers later but didn't take much notice.   Which is unfortunate because I got all the way home before realising that they'd left the security tag on.  That meant a long trek back to Parade to get it removed.  Nice blonde girl was on again and was apologetic.  Poor thing-she was trying to remove the tag and had the owner calling her asking if she was finding items for customers (trying to make them buy more).  When she said a tag had been left on, the owner said \"good\".  Good for whom, I'm not so sure.  Perhaps the walk did me good.  Certainly not good for my sanity or her business.  On a positive note though, they had changed the HST sign to make it less misleading.\n\nIn summary-some cute dresses and many are quite affordable.  Prices range from $150 to $450-but it's hard to tell much difference in quality between the things.  Maybe 10% of the stock is cute, the rest is so-so with lots of repeats.  I'm not sure I can put up with the stress of shopping there again though.  We'll see how many social engagements come my way...",

I eventually realised I could eat tuna a couple of years ago but that was as far as my fish eating went.  Raw fish?  Out of the question.\nFast forward to yesterday. I happened to be in the area at the same time as a friend and he was starving. He's a regular here and was in the mood for sushi. I wasn't hungry but said I'd come along for a chat. I went through that slightly awkward moment where I had to tell the woman serving us that I only wanted water but she was completely sweet about it.  She was so sweet that she came back with salad and miso soup for both of us!  I thought that was just the nicest touch.   She returned a little later with his rolls-spicy salmon and tuna ones which looked huge. We decided that it was time for me to be adventurous and taste some.  My first taste of sushi ever.  Remember, I don't like fishy things. This was yummy!  I ate 2 pieces each of the tuna and the salmon and loved them. Not fishy; just tasty, meaty and satisfying. It was a revelation!  Everything tasted fresh and our service was so friendly and smiley that I couldn't help but feel happy.\nSo this will be forever remembered as the place I first ate sushi and liked it.  Not fishy fish that a non fish-eater will eat?  That's impressive!",

Essence of Life is seriously good though. It has everything! Fresh food, bulk bins, bars, tea, coffee, baking ingredients, nut butters, every type of natural sweetener, chocolate... The list goes on! They have a particularly well stocked and nicely organized supplement section and actually seem to know about their stock. I've priced some of the Vega stuff and they are miles under the prices at Loblaws, Whole Foods etc. I also love it that they have lots of single sachets of the protein powders/greens mixes etc at the cash register. You get to try before committing to a big tub!\n\nStaff are nice and helpful and it definitely feels less cramped than Tutti Frutti; however the aisles are still pretty tight and it tends to be busy so be prepared to suck in your stomach to let people pass by. It's also cramped because it's so jam-packed full of everything you could want. Between TF and here there is absolutely no need to pay Whole Paycheque (Foods) prices. And this feels like a community too. Love it!",

I've had to go there three times and I'd rather stick pins in my eyes than go there again.  \n\nThe subterranean location increases the feeling that this is the waiting room before you enter the depths of hell.  I think it tends to be a bit quieter early in the morning, but my quickest visit was still approximately 20mins.  You wait to get a number to go wait some more.  The chairs are hard with mystery stains.  I recommend bringing a book but reading it is potentially perilous-the numbers and letters seem to come up almost randomly so it's hard to predict how long you'll be there.  Meanwhile, there's the fun of screaming children and the rest of the coughing, sneezing waiting room and looking at the empty desks devoid of assistants.\n\nWhen you eventually get served, the staff are generally nice.  I wasn't as impressed by the first person I dealt with though-she kept moaning to the girl next to her about how hungry she was, scowled, ignored me to eavesdrop on the conversation next to her and then spelled my name wrong for my OHIP card so I ended up stuck with a second visit.\n\nI'm trying to think of positive things to say.  Apart from one rude person, most have been nice.  I suppose I also can't complain too much about getting a card that ensures I have health care.   And.....that's about it!",

It's the Royal York. They'd know afternoon tea, surely?\n\nBooking was easy thanks to Open Table and we were both really looking forward to our girlie meet-up. The welcome at reception was warm which boded well. I can't say I loved the bar itself, unfortunately. It's pretty dark and gloomy. Maybe that's the atmosphere they're going for, but it was more crypt than classy. Our server came over to us with menus almost immediately so that we could start into our important decision making.\n\nThe traditional tea is $39.50 and includes sandwiches, scones and pastries (http://www.fairmont.com/royal-york-toronto/pdf/ryh-library-bar-tea-menu-may-13/). Thankfully they also allow a la carte ordering. ST and I are like Jack Spratt and his wife when it comes to afternoon tea (we like different things) so we decided on one full tea with extra scones ($10) and tea ($5). \n\nSandwiches were fine. I ate the turkey and caprese ones. Scones were also OK. They're tiny! Like mini scones. Two of them are equivalent to one normal scone I'd think. My Mum's are infinitely better. Jam was Hero in little pots, not all fancied up in bowls or anything. The cream was apparently Harmony farms. It just seemed a bit over-whipped.\n\nI really liked the chocolate truffle cake! The macarons were decent and the mousse was pretty tasty. I wouldn't really go out of my way to get it again.\n\nMy tea was kind of lukewarm and while they were technically loose leaf at one stage, they were loose leaf poured into a bag and put in the pot. The purists may take issue. \n\nIt took a while to get our bill, and when we did they'd charged for 2 teas. Thankfully they were quick to change it when we let them know. \n\nOverall it was fine but far from spectacular. i wouldn't go again. I'm giving a 3/5 because I'm nice. ST has higher standards and reckoned it was a 2. With hashtag epicfail. Tough, isn't she?",

I have to admit that I was a little apprehensive buying this one-there weren't any unfiltered Yelp reviews and that's my main way of researching anything. A blog post talking about how wonderful April is made me think it was worth a try though...and who can resist cut and colour for $39?\n\nFirst impressions for me come from how easy it is to ask questions or book appointments before I trudge in the door. They win on this because they answered my emails promptly and allowed me to book my appointment without picking up the phone. So preferable to having my boss give me evils while I organise my hair during working hours. And it also means I have the date and time in writing. It would not be unusual for me to have forgotten what time I picked by the time I hang up the phone.\n\nI was lucky enough to get a Saturday afternoon appointment just before Christmas and on the final day of my voucher. They left a message the day before to remind me and also let me know that there was parking available and to be careful on the roads because the forecast was bad. I thought that was so sweet! More brownie points.\n\nI arrived slightly late and looking like a drowned rat thanks to an ice storm. My stylist, Vesta, greeted me and took away my sopping wet coat. I was also given the opportunity to ditch my boots and put on slippers. So nice and cosy! The salon looks small from the street but there's also a downstairs which is where we went. Everything was spotless and the decor is modern and monochrome.\n\nI can't say enough positive things about Vesta. She was a dream. The time flew by because she was so sweet and such fun to chat to. None of the usual small talk about holidays! I didn't even reach for my book the whole time. She listened to what I wanted and made a real effort to work with me to achieve it-both in terms of colour and cut. I love the shade we chose and my new 'do. We went for a bit of side bang and she told me that I can come back to go shorter if I feel brave. For free! It's nice to not feel at all pressured. I get to see how well I cope with this first instead of having to jump straight in. Think she definitely got my personality!\n\nSo yes. Recommend. Cosy, friendly salon with staff who listen, make you tea and want you to leave happy. Pretty perfect.\n\nP.S.: Free wifi\n         Super easy to find: just north of Davenport on the west side of Avenue",

The layout and products suggest that this is Loblaw's attempt to pitch their services to the well-heeled business types in the Bay & Bloor area.\n\nSuperficially, they've done a decent job.  It has quite a cute look and they've managed a slightly exclusive feel.  Once you actually dig a bit deeper though, it's just a normal supermarket with some nice signage and enthusiastic pricing.  The layout and merchandising is strange and doesn't make much sense to me-there is no real ordered flow to it.\n\nI didn't feel like the products were particularly exclusive.  It's still like Loblaws-President's Choice and regular name brand.  Very little that seemed exciting or interesting.  Prices were pretty much like Loblaws on Queens Quay-high enough-but they had the same weekly specials. \n\nCheck-out was painful in the extreme.  Loblaws seem to train their staff to scan as slowly as possible.  I think I was 10 mins getting my 3 items even though there were only 2 people with small baskets in front of me.   This would be a definite deterrent to me shopping here again.  It was so slow that I claimed I had no change in my purse when Julius, the slowest cashier ever, asked me for it.  I just could not bear yet more time spent there while he counted it slooooowly.\n\nGood enough place to pick up your favourite PC goodies if you happen to be in the area I suppose.

I needed to find somewhere appropriate for beginners.  The array of MMA centres in Toronto is a bit dizzying-particularly if you've never done any kind of martial arts before.  Thanks to my Google searching, I came across Open Mat and liked the idea of the free one-on-one introductory session.\nI managed to make my appointment via email-it took a bit of time because they mainly arrange things over the phone.  I eventually got a slot with Devin on a Sunday.    I decided to go to the gym and for a run first because it was just a lesson and turned up ready for action at around midday.\nThe gym is upstairs on Yonge and was pretty quiet at that time.  The space is great-very open with shiny new equipment.  The changing rooms were spotlessly clean with nice showers and plenty of shower gel, shampoo, conditioner etc etc.\nI had a really fun session with Devin learning how to punch and kick.  His instructions were good and he really watched to see that I was picking it up and that my form was good.  I thoroughly enjoyed the lesson.  What I enjoyed a little less was the fitness test at the end.  If I'd known in advance I don't think I would have gone running and hit the weights before doing timed pushups, burpees and a wall-sit!\nThen came the chat.   I started by telling him how much I hated the hard sell I got at Extreme Fitness where they expected me to sign up that day.  I think that may have kind of ruined his moment a few seconds later where he had to take out the folder with the membership rates.  It included special offer discounts if I signed up that day.  Perks like free DVD and t-shirt for early sign-up etc.  I wasn't allowed to get a copy of the rate schedules from him but they were expensive...somewhere between $100 and $140 per month for 2 classes per week I think.  It didn't suit me for a number of reasons-they wanted a commitment to a particular class which is really difficult with my job and it was far too expensive.\nSo nice facility and good teaching.  If you have the money and have a more regular schedule than I do it's worth a go.  There's a 30 day free trial offer but I ended up not going through with it because it affected the price of the packages if you wanted to get them after.  I really don't like feeling tricked or coerced into a membership or any kind of opacity when it comes to rates so had to knock it down to a 3.",

He's a regular, but couldn't really help because he's enjoyed pretty much everything he's eaten there.   Our server was lovely and was very patient when she had to go away and come back because I was deciding for so long (my tendency to start chatting too much when I'm handed a menu doesn't help).  In the end I settled on green curry chicken with coconut rice and he had the pad thai with chicken and shrimp.  The dishes were served in lovely silver bowls which helped to make it seem special.\nPrices are reasonable and the mains we had were just the right size.  They have a wine menu and a few desserts but we stuck with the one course.  The lovely staff allowed us to linger over it and we never felt rushed.\nAs for the food?  All I managed to say as we left was \"num num!\".  It was really delicious.  I was utterly content as I ate my curry and think I kept a little happy tummy smile on my face for a few hours after.  I need to go back to try the rest of the menu.  This place could be looking at 5 stars!",

It's a brand new Belgian waffle and cupcake bar in the surprisingly good VBTG food court. I sometimes think I've developed some sort of sugar spidey sense-I actually managed to stumble upon this place on the opening day. My peripheral vision can miss doorways, people, cars etc but managed to spot the sign that promised waffles and cupcakes.\n\nIt was pretty busy for the first day and they apologised that they were still in test mode-only cash payments today and they'd run out of some cupcakes. The people serving were friendly though and the space is bright and sparkly. They had some waffle samples out which were tasty. I decided to get my usual \"test\" cupcake for cupcakeries from them-a red velvet. I'm so often disappointed by the offerings. I wasn't today! It was light, sweet and tasty with a perfect ratio of bun to frosting. And at $3.33 after tax it won't completely bankrupt you. Other varieties I spotted included chocolate peanut butter, banana peanut butter, green tea, chocolate, vanilla.... \n\nSo-it's pretty much the worst thing that could have happened in my neighbourhood. A place that serves yummy cupcakes in close proximity to me. And with the aroma of fresh waffles. I'm doomed.",

The best ones are when it's from Daniel et Daniel. They tend to provide a mixture of healthy stuff and a little less healthy but there's rarely anything that is in any way like junk food. It's good meat, tons of veggies and some kind of starch and always tastes fresh. My all-time favourite was the day we had the bouef bourgignon. I wanted to take the tray home with me!\n\nThe meal is only a prelude to dessert for me so it's important to note that they know how to do sweet treats. I would quite happily just eat their desserts all day long. They usually give us little 2 bite versions of things but they're so delicious-cheesecakes, brownies, little tarts. I don't think I've ever had a bad dessert from them. \n\nCounting down the days to the next Free Lunch Friday. My best meal of the month!",

For some reason, red velvet tastes like cherries to me; but it's still yummy. If you're pretending to be healthy, they usually have some lower calorie options and sorbet.\n\nOnce you've filled your cup you get to go to town on the wide variety of toppings. Cookie dough bites, chocolate chips, peanut butter cups. Drool. And the sauces are delicious. I find it really difficult not to drench my froyo in chocolate and peanut butter sauces. Healthy? Hardly.

Roughing it ceased to seem like fun many years ago so I was pretty desperate to get furniture and the Brick seemed pretty cheap and an easy way to get everything in one fell swoop.  Actually, it would have been easier to go fell some trees and whittle my own...but I didn't know that then.\n\n-The store looks pretty good.  Not fantastic furniture but seemed pretty decent for the price.  I was there on June 30th.\n-Should probably have walked out when sales assistant initially trailed me around asking if I had decided yet (repeatedly) and then let me wait while he dealt with someone else...but I really wanted some furniture\n-Most of the couches I wanted were not due in for a month so I went with one that was nice enough and picked out a little dining table, 4 chairs, a side display unit, small armchair and an ottoman.\n-Couch, table, armchair and ottoman available immediately (next available date July 4th); rest due in July 8th.  I had chosen a chest of drawers from the clearance section and asked for it to be delivered in the 2nd delivery.\n-My credit card needed authorisation (Irish, big bill) and they told me to ring on my mobile.  \n-Was told Sunday delivery would be morning-actually 2pm.  Not good when you have to book an elevator\n-I got an OK couch, a filthy cream chair covered in black smudges and blue lines and an ottoman with a broken leg.   The table was self assembly and needed 8 screws.  One of them was a nail type thing instead.\n-Rang customer service...they said the items could be replaced on Thursday (8th).  It didn't happen\n-Got a message about my second delivery on Wed 7th saying they would be there at 5pm.  I had not arranged this date.  No contact number available to tell them that I would not be there.  They arrived and would not wait until I got home from work.  Rescheduled.\n-Asked customer service if I could cancel the order.  They said a manager would ring me.  They didn't.\n-Delivery service rang yesterday (Sat 10th) saying they had my chairs etc and chest.  Said I didn't want the chairs.  Attempted to ring customer service.  They were busy apparently.  They would ring back.  They didn't.\n-Delivery guy gave slot of 12-3pm.  Rang at 3pm saying he'd arrive at 4pm.  Arrived at 6.50pm.\n-Chairs provided with no screws to affix seat pad to chair.  Side display unit missing holes for screws.\n-Rang customer service.  Manager to ring me back.  Didn't.\n\nHave emailed and spent far too long on the phone.  My apartment now contains a dirty armchair, a broken ottoman, a shelving unit that can't be made, chairs with unattached seat pads and a table that is still missing a bit.  Customer service are not helping and I have paid almost $1000 for total crap.\n\nThe Brick might seem glossy and like a nice way of saving money but the Prozac and Valium you will take when you see the rubbish you get more than cancels out any savings.  Just don't do it!",

I don't necessarily expect brilliance anyway.  I presume they like to keep costs down, so I doubt they recruit from the MBA special interest group at Mensa meetings.\nIt's hard to remember much about the shopping trips.  I was in a bit of a trance/fugue state.  You can buy pretty much everything you could want for your home in here (including food) and the prices are REALLY good.  I was sick of Shoppers Drug Mart trying to charge me double the US price for Neutrogena for example....Walmart doesn't.    Picked up lots of bits and pieces and will go back for more.  Possibly with a car next time.  Dragging furniture on the subway could prove challenging.\nI know their corporate policies have been held up as dubious and it's hardly fancy, but right now I need to save some money and it completely fits the bill.  Biggest complaint is the lack of freaks shopping there.  People of Walmart (http://www.peopleofwalmart.com) lied to me!",

I was a bit concerned having read a good few suboptimal reviews on Tripadvisor but was pleasantly surprised!\nIt's not somewhere you feel very pampered but I don't think it's really what they're aiming for.  They say it's Vastu inspired.  It felt more like an upscale hostel in a way-but in a positive sense!\nThe welcome was pleasant and I was shown to my room on the 3rd floor.  I was glad I'd left my big suitcases in the B&B I was spending the rest of my time in-there was no way I could have taken them up the steep narrow staircase.  The room was pretty basic but open and spotless.  Firm queen bed, big dresser, some hooks on the wall and a tiny TV.  I liked having a coffee maker, microwave and fridge.  The bathroom was also spotless with a copper sink and small tub.  Tea, coffee and granola bars were provided in the room with more in the lobby downstairs.\nIt's pretty much a self sufficient experience.  No staff are on site after 7pm although there's an emergency number to ring.  There's no breakfast-extra granola bars and some oatmeal packets are left downstairs but they weren't replenished until I was almost ready to check out.  The location is good though at Spadina/Bloor and literally next door to the Spadina North subway station.  \nSo, not the home from home of some B&Bs but spotless and convenient if you just want to do your own thing!",

Let's say 4.5!\n\nThis No Frills seems to be pretty new.  Everything is bright and shiny and sparkling.  The fruit and veg section is pretty large and everything looked appealing and fresh on both occasions I've been in over the past week.  Prices were also good.  There is a little fresh bread section with bagels etc to take individually but no huge diet-ruining bakery.  There is a pharmacy though.  Handy!\n\nGreat bargains on a wide range of grocery items-everything from dairy to tinned goods to the Woolite that was $3 cheaper than at Shopper's Drug Mart.  The President's Choice items didn't seem to be priced much differently to Loblaws or Bloorstreet Market but overall my bags of groceries were much cheaper than usual.\n\nAisles are wide and it seemed pretty calm in there on a weekday.  It will probably get busier as more people find it-there's a good catchment area and I'm sure people living in the area will be more than happy not to pay the crazy prices Metro seem to think they can charge. ($3.59 for a litre of milk.  Seriously?!?).\n\nCheckout was quick and pleasant.  It seems counterintuitive that the discount arm of the Loblaws family of stores has better service than the supposedly high-end Loblaws and Bloorstreet Market, but that was my experience this week.  The girl didn't recognise my parsnip and thought it was bok choi...but at least she was pleasant!\n\nDefinitely going back-even if it means having to get one of those old woman shopping trollies to bring everything home.

Everything else was great.\n\nMy first experience with Toronto Airport Express was a few years ago when I was coming to Toronto from Ireland for a job interview.  I wanted to reassure myself about which stop to get off at so emailed.  Their response was speedy and friendly.  I remember the whole experience as being hassle free.\n\nI've had another chance to check them out recently.  I'd bought a couple of discount return vouchers as a group buy on the off-chance that someone from home might miss me-thus necessitating a trip to the airport.   My little sister cracked eventually so I got to use my vouchers to collect her and bring her back.  it was fantastic.  The buses run every 20 mins during the day and every 30 mins in the evening from multiple hotels around the city.  I got a total of 4 buses in the space of 10 days and each was precisely on time.  All the staff-4 different drivers and the office staff-were friendly, helpful and smiley.  The buses were spotlessly clean and the (fast) wifi and power outlets on board were a major plus.\n\nThey went above and beyond when I did something typically scatterbrained and left my cardigan behind when bringing little sis back to the airport.  It was a raggedy Old Navy one...but I still wanted it.  I decided to take a chance on emailing them to ask if it had been found.  I got a reply later asking for a description to confirm what it looked like.  They had found it!  They sent it into the office at the Royal York hotel where I picked it up a couple of days later.  I couldn't believe they went to the trouble for my bobbly cheap cardigan.  I'm a fan for life now!\n\nNotes:\n-They have a downtown office at the Royal York hotel where you can buy tickets or pick up timetables\n-Website has images of where to stand for pick-up at the various hotels.

This was number one!\n\nWe strolled in after our first ever attempts at skating.  All the trying not to fall over while toddlers whizzed past worked up quite an appetite and we were pondering where to get lunch.  Since we were passing Real Sports we thought we'd just go in to have a look around.  The group was me, my friend Karen, Niall and one year old Emily in a stroller.  Not exactly the typical clientele, I'm guessing.\n\nAt 3pm on a Saturday it was pretty busy and many of the tables were reserved.  I think there may have been a hockey game that night, but being female and from Ireland my knowledge ends with the fact that they play hockey on ice wearing skates.  They still managed to find us a table when we decided to eat there, with  the proviso that we were finished by 5pm.\n\nThe place is huge.  An enormous screen almost fills one wall and there are countless smaller TVs below showing a range of games.  You can sit at the bar, at high bar tables, in booths or at tables on the main floor, or in a quieter area with booths where we ended up.  Each one has a TV with many sporting channels to flick through.\n\nFood was surprisingly decent.  I had a tasty bean soup and a glass of white wine.  I didn't get to sample much of Niall's burger and fries-they were devoured, so I'm assuming they were good.  I \"helped\" Karen with her mound of moreish nachos.  What can I say?  I'm a giver.\n\nStaff were very friendly.  Emily was particularly entranced by the servers at our table.  I'm not sure whether it was their big smiles or their prominent cleavage that made her follow them around.  I think she was a bit thirsty.\n\nAll in all, enjoyable!  It would be good for a group outing-if you reserved ahead of time.  Prices weren't as bad as I thought they'd be considering the size of the place and proximity to the Air Canada Centre.   If only they started screening rugby matches they'd have the entire Irish population of Toronto sitting there!\n\n\n\nFootnote:\n*I can't really follow that show.  I get confused between them all-they all look the same with blonde hair/implants/inflated egos.  I can also never figure out which ones are fighting at any given moment.

I had a girl called Jessica at that time and the cut was fine but I don't think we clicked so I hadn't been in a rush to go back.\n\nOne of the great things about Civello is that they give you a $25 gift card after your first visit. I'd been carrying it around for ages and had half forgotten about it. Then, in typical disorganized me fashion, I was a few days from a trip away with hair like a rat's nest and no appointment made for a cut. I had a voucher for Toni & Guy but they had no availability so I wandered into Civello on the off-chance that they could fit me in. It was so easy to get the time I wanted which was late on a Saturday evening. I just love their opening hours! The guy at reception was very friendly and after a chat about what I wanted recommended Morgan.\n\nOn the day, I arrived and discovered that he had accidentally put me with Kennedy instead. I'm sure Morgan would have been great, but it actually worked really well for me that I had Kennedy! One of those happy accidents. She was so sweet and was really motivated to help me to keep length in my hair. I hate being scalped! I'm hairdresser phobic but she put me at ease. No Valium needed this time. We had an extensive consultation, she washed my hair herself and she took great care with the cut. I liked it that she didn't flat iron it before cutting and we got to agree on how much was going. The cut is much better than the one I got at Parlour and she was cheaper too-$55. She was chatty and really easy to get along with. I will definitely go back to her!\n\nThe salon itself is clean and you get a nice robe to cover you so no annoying hair bits afterwards. I love that the chairs at the sinks are basically beds and the Aveda products. The little shoulder massage is a nice touch and it was also a nice surprise that there was a Yelp check-in bonus of shampoo samples. The refreshments are also great-I love my coffee! Again, Parlour failed on that.\n\nThere's nothing I can fault after that experience really. I was scheduled with the wrong person, but it ended up working out beautifully. I'm still really happy with the cut-my hair is much more manageable and looks far better than after my more expensive Parlour cut. I'm a fan!",

Yelp informed me that this was one of the closest places to home and I'm pretty lazy on a Saturday afternoon. I was relieved to find that they were open until 6.30pm. The store is a cornucopia of screws, nails, washers, mousetraps, bathroom items and random things like cooking pots. I meandered up and down the aisles for  a while, planning my return trip for things I don't need. I think you could find pretty much anything here.\nAfter a few minutes I heard some weird squeaking sounds so I looked down towards the back of the shop and was pretty surprised to see a mini pet shop with caged birds and fish tanks! I am now officially a fan of random unexpected hardware store pet shops. It was the last thing I expected to see!\nI eventually wandered towards the front counter with my key in hand.

My two copies were made in two minutes flat and presented to me with another face-splitting, beaming smile. \"Guaranteed!\" I was promised. The price? $3 for the two keys. And I've checked. They work perfectly.\nSo they get 4 stars. For surprising me with an unexpected menagerie, for giving me such wonderfully warm service and for making me feel like I got a bargain!",

Now most places have hard wooden chairs like it's an office and like they're hoping you leave soon. Aroma is different. It actually has pretty comfy little armchairs! It was buzzing when I ducked in to shelter from the mid-May hailstorm but it's pretty roomy and I managed to snag myself a table with some of the comfy chairs.\n\nIt was a pleasure to get a nice mug of coffee and getting a little chocolate with it is a nice touch. It's a tiny little thing but changes the experience from the purely functional Tim Hortons run to a pleasant experience.\n\nStaff were lovely and service was quick. It's a bit loud in there due to the sheer volume of people in the cafe but I still enjoyed my little time out and book reading. I'll go back!",

I had a massage booked for a while later though so it made sense to settle here for a quick cup of coffee beforehand.\n\nAshe served me and was just so so friendly and welcoming.  Her chatty demeanour made me feel like this was a real local coffee shop.  I watched as other people entered later and it was clear that they were regulars and really felt at home here.\n\nThe place is small but doesn't feel poky-just cosy.  I loved all the weathered wood.  Clientele was mixed and it had a nice chilled out ambience.  The girl next to me was tapping away at her laptop using hte free wi-fi.  I was happy to sit reading my book with my great cup of coffee...although the conversation next to me was way more interesting.  There are advantages to closely placed tables!\n\n$2 for a medium filter coffee seemed reasonable and it was smooth and not a bit bitter.  For once, I decided against stuffing my face, so can't comment on the food but the guy next to me had what looked like a delicious scone!  I'll definitely be back to test some of the baked goods.  It would be so bad to leave my review incomplete, after all!",

        "text": "The only real passion that Pogue Mahone's inspired in us was a passionate debate on the nature of a real \"Irish pub\".  This was probably inevitable considering there were six Irish people squashed into a snug in a Toronto pub.  We couldn't really decide in the end, but the most genuine Irish pubs seemed to be the ones you wouldn't really want to go into without some hand sanitiser-outside toilets featured for many.\n\nPogue Mahones, on the other hand, was clean and comfortable.  Service was at our table and friendly.  They had  a pretty good range of drinks and even obliged with a basket of fries when people got  a bit peckish (although if it was an Irish pub they'd be called chips).  It was cosy in the snug and there were nice fireplaces to sit beside in the main bar.\n\nWhy the 3 stars?  Well, it's definitely not an Irish pub for a number of reasons:\n\n-It was pretty dead on a Saturday night.  A few people were scattered around but it was definitely quiet.  \n-It's nice and sociable in a snug but the rest of it is a bit soulless.\n-You rarely get table service in an Irish pub.  Trying to catch the barman's eye by bouncing up and down at the bar is how you burn off those alcohol calories\n-Most damning of all-they celebrate things like Burns night.  That would be Scottish.  The least Irish thing you can possibly do is to think Ireland/Scotland/England; they're all the same aren't they?  Call it some kind of Celtic pub if you like, but it's most certainly not Irish.",

        "text": "So, I doubt I was their ideal customer.  I landed into the salon 45 minutes before closing clutching a Fabfind voucher for a manicure and pedicure.  The guy who greeted me made a face when he saw it.  I asked if I was too late in the evening and he said no, then found someone to take me.  Still not sure if the sneery look was because of the voucher or the time.\n\nThe salon is pretty new and they've made a real effort to be trendy.  It's all done in pink and black with swathes of pink tulle facing the pedicure seats and 2 big TVs on the wall.  They were showing Britain's Next Top Model when I was there...but the volume was off and I didn't see any jack for headphones.  I was offered a glass of water which was a pleasant surprise and it came complete with a little chocolate.  Spotted a nice coffee machine by the reception desk too so that might be a perk of a haircut!  It seemed clean too...although it would look even nicer if they kept the brooms out of sight instead of throwing them in the corner.\n\nThe woman doing my pedicure was civil but not exactly friendly.  She did a nice enough job but didn't seem particularly happy with feet/her job/life.  The girl doing my manicure was lovely though and just smiled sweetly when I pressed the wrong button on the massage chair and started slowly sliding backwards.  She also carried my bag and sandals to the dryers and helped me put my sandals back on afterwards so that I didn't smudge.  I really liked that!\n\nHours are good too-open until 8pm most weekdays.\n\n\nThings I didn't like:\n-Apart from the girl doing my manicure, they weren't that friendly.  At all.\n-Some of the staff were having an animated discussion/complaining session over my feet.  I wished for headphones because I felt like I was intruding on some personal stuff.\n-I wanted to give a $5 tip but ended up giving $10 because they didn't give me my change\n-There was a LOT of money management around me.  Big discussions regarding my voucher, how much I'd paid, how much other people had tipped.  The girls were passing handfuls of notes back and forth to each other.  I just felt awkward and cheap.  Couldn't wait for the dryer to finish so that I could escape!\n\nOverall, I got a decent manicure and pedicure-especially considering I had a discount voucher.  There were nice elements like the water and chocolate, but overall I didn't find it relaxing and wouldn't rush to go back.  The experience didn't exactly inspire me to check out their hair services either!",

The bus to the airport arrived just as I got to the Fairmont which was great. The waiting in the terminal for the ferry followed by the world's most ridiculously pointless ferry ride was a little less amazing but didn't really take too much time of out my day. The sooner that bit is done away with the better.\n\nLine for check-in was short but moved quite slowly. It didn't help that one woman seemed to have a broken printer. The guy I had at check-in was awful. Dour, unsmiling, unfriendly, curt and verging on downright rude. Probably the most unpleasant person I've had at a check-in desk-and I've flown budget airlines in Europe where I'm sure they're considering charging for saying hello to you soon. If you see the middle-aged kind of slightly ginger (and probably scowling) man beckoning; pretend you're doing a random act of kindness and let the person behind you have the joy. He did not give a good impression or start my trip well. \n\nLoved the lounge with the newspapers, cookies, coffee, tea and water. The free wifi also worked well while I was waiting to keep me entertained until boarding.\n\nBoarding was efficient and I was soon all tucked up in a pretty comfortable seat, ready for take-off. Cabin crew were so lovely. They almost made up for cranky check-in guy! Take-off was on time and we were barely in the air before they were serving us drinks. The novelty of coffee in a real cup! Imagine! I felt like a princess. I think my expectations may have been severely lowered over the years.\n\nOne uneventful flight later and we were in Newark. Said goodbye to the lovely crew and got to breeze through the airport there and jump on a train into Manhattan. Good times!",

I was going to try to be strict and hard nosed and give 4; but they were just so incredibly pleasant again that I'm stuck with 5 stars and looking very soft!\n\nMy \"good\" glasses lost a screw, and after dropping it in an attempt to repair them and spending an hour crawling around the floor, I decided that I was probably due a new pair anyway. It's been too long-4 years!-since my last eye exam so that needed to be done too. I emailed a few places to ask about rates and appointments but they either didn't answer or were charging $120+ for an eye exam. Things weren't looking good. Then I spotted a Groupon for Optical Thirty 8 offering $150 off the price of frames for $19. Sounded tempting. \n\nFrom the very first contact, I was impressed. I submitted a query about exams and pricing via the contact form and got a response in under 24hrs. GiGi answered all my stupid questions and I booked my eye exam for the following Sunday and bought my Groupon. Exams are $75 but you can manage to get a free exam if you're spending over $198 (at the moment). They called to confirm ahead of time and suggested that I could come in early to look in case my pupils were dilated afterwards!\n\nI arrived just 5 minutes before to a warm welcome. I filled out a medical intake form and they took my old broken glasses to figure out the old prescription. Then it was time for the optometrist. I had Shala Lakhani who was absolutely lovely, knowledgeable and super efficient. Once I'd tried to figure out whether option 1 or 2 was better for each lens (I never know!), it was off to choose new frames.\n\nI generally hate choosing frames. It seems so daunting and I get confused. I also get sick of looking at my face after trying on a few pairs. Luckily, Elan was a joy and super patient. Between the two of us, we picked a pair that I really like and it wasn't too astronomically expensive after the Groupon. Lenses with the standard coatings (pretty much everything) were $88. While I'd been in my exam they'd fixed my old glasses so I trotted off with them and some free cleaning spray and wipes. Hurrah!\n\nMy glasses were ready the next weekend and they made a courtesy call to confirm that. Elan remembered me when I walked in and somebody also presented me with a cup of tea the minute I sat down. The fit was perfect but they said to pop back for any adjustments or repairs and I got even more cleaning spray and wipes. Rubbing them on your sweater is not a good thing, apparently. Who knew?\n\nSo couldn't really give them less than 5. Every single person was incredibly pleasant, they gave me tea, the exams aren't a rip off and they have some lovely glasses. 5 stars it is.",

They were just in that day and warm from the oven!  I decided on an iced one and she deliberated over them trying to find the one with the best pattern-one of the others had iced some of them in a spiderweb pattern for the season.  She made a huge effort to put paper on top as well to give me some hope of preserving the icing after placing it in the bag.\nI left the shop smiling.   It wasn't just the prospect of the blood sugar spike, it was mainly the sweet service.  The fact that the scone was light, fluffy and delicious was almost just a bonus!",

There were plenty of slots that day according to the website.  When I went in I headed to the bar at the back where a guy stood with an iPad and checked me in, then pointed me to a free stool.  I was waiting a while beyond my given time but after a while was taken to Adam.  He wasn't enormously chatty but was nice.  I needed a new part which he ordered in-said it would be 5 business days or so.  He managed to fix the other issue after a few attempts at trying different things.  I was kind of glad he didn't fix it in 2 seconds.  I would have felt totally stupid!  He answered all my questions really patiently. \n\n5 business days later I got a call saying my part was in.  I made another appointment and headed in.  Again, there was a bit of a wait.  The store is really stuffy.  I suggest wearing layers if going in there!  Cyril looked after me this time and took my laptop into the back to fit the part.  The big bonus was that it was all free-even though they technically could have charged, despite my Applecare agreement.\n\nI liked it that they conferred between themselves when they were having an issue or wondering how to do something.  Sometimes there were two of them trying to figure out how to get a rebellious iPhone to connect or a MacBook to behave.  I overheard quite a bit of a learning session with an older woman.  I have no idea how the genius managed to stay so patient with her.  Claps for him!  I couldn't do that job...",

Seems like a few places in the vicinity don't want to put on their happy morning faces until 11am or 11.30am so Cafe la Gaffe won partly based on being open. The menu was the most enticing thing, however. It's pretty extensive with something for most tastes-a mix of breakfast, brunch and lunch foods.\n\nOur welcome was warm and we were placed at the window table which is a tiny 2-seater. It was a little tight but adorable. We basked in the winter sun and tried to figure out what to eat. The menu is large to begin with but they also add specials and it was really difficult to choose. In the end, I went with a chorizo omelette served with salad and home fries and she went with the sausage breakfast.\n\nMy meal wasn't piping hot but was very tasty and came with fresh fruit on the side. So filling! I felt envious of my sister's sausage breakfast, however. The sausages were delicious and it also came with some very tasty toast that I just had to sample. For Yelp, of course. I think I'll get that the next time. Or maybe the french toast. Too much choice!\n\nService was excellent. I felt sorry for the server, unfortunately. She was so sweet but she was trying to run the place all by herself. It was too much. She was very attentive despite this-I think I had around 10 cups of coffee because she refilled my cup every time I got about half way down. She never lost her smile and pleasant demeanour regardless of  the number of tables either.\n\nOverall we had an extremely satisfying and very relaxing brunch. It's not bad value either at $10-$14 per plate. I'll be back!",

At least trying to decide which unpleasant sensation was dominant helped to pass the time while I walked through here....\n\nIt's quite small for a grocery store but is made to feel smaller by the high shelving and narrow aisles.  It feels dark and grubby and even with a few people in there it seemed packed.  There was a faint rotting smell around the fruit and veg section-I decided not to investigate it.  The milk shelves were almost bare as if they hadn't been merchandised all day.  I didn't spot many staff around except on the check-outs.  Probably just as well-it felt oppressively crowded as it was.\n\nProducts here are usual mix of brand names, no name and President's Choice at lovely No Frills prices.  Not the best selection due to the size of the store but more than adequate for a basic grocery shop.\n\nI think Luciano has moved to pastures cleaner with the new Front St store (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/lucianos-no-frills-toronto-2#hrid:VkaJTxmq8whKIz7v8iFkbQ/src:self)  so the name may change.   Perhaps the new franchisee may also make it a more pleasant shopping experience.  I suspect that may involve demolition and rebuilding, but you never know.

I had just watched Waitress again the first time I wandered by and it was as if the  shop had been deposited in my path by an act of God.  I almost ran in, all ready to pie it up!\nIt's kind of quirky inside.  Very dark so that you can barely see really, but that also means it's pleasantly cool on a humid July day.o  There are 2 chilled display cabinets of full pies and pie by the slice with a cupcake display on top and a display of cake slices on the counter nearby.  All looked yummy!\nThe first time I went in I decided on the coconut cream pie.   Service was OK-just.  I wasn't too keen on the pie itself.  Perhaps it was the too high expectations from recently watching a movie heavily involving delicious and adventurous pies....but this didn't do it for me.  It was a bit bland with huge bits of shredded coconut running through it.  I didn't finish my slice.  Second attempt-decided on a slice.  I tried to peer through the gloom inside to figure out which slice was which and eventually asked the girl which one was the peanut slice.  \"The one with the peanuts on it\", she snapped.  Nice!  Anyway, I bought it.  Again, not impressed.  Pretty tasteless, especially considering that it's quite pricey.  And I don't really like being treated like an imbecile when I'm trying to buy comfort food.  I had more than enough of that while I was in training for my job.\nSo.....today I decided to see if it was 3rd time lucky.  it was hot and humid and had started to rain.  My diet is starting tomorrow (marking day one number 10,004) and it seemed appropriate to try another pie.  The guys serving me today were lovely-really friendly-and I got nods of approval for my choice.  It seemed like the obvious one when my eyes landed on it-red velvet cake.  They packaged it to take away and I carried my precious cargo home with me.  It was delicious.   Really excellent.  I hate the word moist, but I don't know how else to describe a really good cake that practically melts in the mouth with not a hint of dryness.  The layers were interspersed with cream cheese and it a cream cheese topping.  All of this is past tense considering it didn't last long once I had put a fork into it!  It is a bit much for an everyday treat at $4.99 per slice but the portions are generous.\nSo....final verdict?  I'll probably go back for the red velvet but it hasn't dragged itself up to a full 4 stars yet!",

Just to put things in perspective, it was the weekend of the G20 summit.  The day before had seen windows broken, ATMs trashed, police cars set alight.... There were police on every street corner as we wandered around looking for somewhere to have brunch.  The police were polite and even smiled.  A couple of them chatted with the little child and tried to get a smile out of him.  Their friendliness was even more striking when compared to the attitude of the staff in Fran's.\nThe place was half empty, but they didn't really seem happy to see us.  We were given menus and a piece of paper and some crayons for the toddler.  My friend chose the full breakfast and I went for waffles with side order of strawberries (extra charge).  His breakfast looked good in a sausages/pancakes/home fries way.  It would definitely keep you going for the day and was pretty good value!  My waffle was nice but the strawberries were terrible.  I got around 4 of them, from a tin, in some kind of nasty juice.  And it was extra.  Coffee was weak but better than nothing I suppose.  \nService was....just about adequate.  They gave us food and we didn't have to wait too long for it.  They were far from friendly though and when the poor little toddler decided he didn't feel like sitting down and wanted to explore he was treated to scowls.  Maybe they should recruit the staff to be part of the riot police next time?\n\nI might go back if I'm craving a big greasy breakfast when everywhere else is closed.  Otherwise?

On a cold day, it's cosy in there and when it's hot and sunny it's a cool escape from the sun and heat.\n\nStaff are very friendly and the prices are in nice big writing behind the counter-very handy for people like me who refuse to wear their glasses! The coffee is good but I think I've been destroyed by Tim Hortons after a few years in Canada. It seems so expensive for brewed coffee-e.g. $1.75 for small (8oz) and $2 for a medium (10oz). That said, it doesn't taste like Timmies either which is probably worth paying for. \n\nThe display case houses a nice selection of cupcakes, slices and cookies. I really want to go back to try the salted caramel and Nutella cookies when I've finished my summer diet!\n\nThe patio outside is lovely and restful. Unfortunately, it's also where the smokers go which means what starts as a nice, relaxing cup of coffee can end in a coughing fit. Not much to be done though-I don't think we're allowed to put them down?\n\nWashrooms are downstairs (there's a door just before the counter) and are spacious and clean. Watch out for the automatic light though-particularly if you decide to loiter while attempting a Yelp check-in.

They had a small selection of baked goods when I popped in at 4pm on a May Thursday. Medium coffee was $2.25 for a pretty small cup-around the size of a tall from Starbucks. It was pretty good but I wouldn't be taking a special trip there to get one and it still pains me to pay that much for filter. Highlight was probably that there is bench seating outside so you can watch the world go by.",

        "text": "All I could think when I tried to sum up this Loblaws was \"no great shakes\". I have no idea where that particular expression originated but the gist of it is not fantastic. \nI was really excited when I saw that they were building a Loblaws here. I've been waiting for it for months and months thinking about how nice it would be to have one on the west side near me. It hasn't transformed my life, however.\n\nIt's a nice size and has some pretty and shiny features like a large bakery, fresh pizza, a wall of cheese and large, inviting cake display. All very classy looking. The more generic part-the bit I actually go for-is less impressive though. \n\nFruit and veg are generally decent; although I've enountered wilted broccoli and softening peppers more than once. I ended up buying perfectly fresh ones in No Frills instead. Like every Loblaws, it's worth looking out for specials on the fruit etc.\n\nSome of the aisles are wide, but others have huge pillars in the middle and they've also placed display stands down the middle of some. It gives it quite a cramped feeling-particularly when you're ducking behind a pillar to let other people pass single file.\n\nCheckouts are sometimes tolerable, sometimes awful. Some of the express ones are 3 cashiers in a row facing the store with no indicator as to how to queue. It's very messy looking. When you actually get to a cashier, they may be civil but I've had a few who made it seem like I was solely responsible for all that is wrong with the world. I slinked out feeling sorry for my existence those days. Not what I really want when I'm paying for the Weston family to live a life of luxury. They've also overcharged me.\n\nSo it's...fine. In the way a woman says \"fine\" and means that they're really somewhere between OK and annoyed at something. in my case, I'm annoyed that they got my hopes up and charge me a premium to be treated like I'm an inconvenience.",

        "text": "This is another thing that is part of my plan not to pay full price for any cosmetic treatment if I can do better with a group buy voucher.  I succumbed to the temptation of drastically reduced cost laser vouchers for Beauty Bar Laser clinic and dreamt about saying goodbye to waxing and shaving.  The blurb also promised that it was pain free thanks to their Soprano XL laser.  Sounded perfect!\n\nMaking an appointment had to be done by phone.  The website is pretty useless and just a page.  They do offer evening appointments though which means it's possible to fit treatments into a work day.  I went with the Yorkville location because it's handy, and also because I had this idea that it might be their nice location.  The girl on the phone was friendly and helpful so I felt pretty confident.  Unfortunately they also always confirm appointments by phone so I always miss them (work) and have to call back.   Wish they'd text or email.\n\nThe first day I arrived I tottered down the steps to the basement location (it's also Bellair Tan) a bit early.  The girl on reception expected me to call out which areas were being treated-while I stood next to the man waiting beside me.  I wasn't thrilled.  I was early and the therapist took me in early.  I don't remember her name, but I do know that the waiting man was her father and he was waiting for her.  She brought me into the treatment room which was tiny and had a man's coat and a handbag hanging on the door.  She left me to get undressed and I looked around for towels etc but didn't see any so went with a kind of semi dressed approach instead.  She was pleasant but seemed a bit rushed.  The whole thing was over in a few minutes.  It was painless but seemed VERY quick.  It all seemed really rough and ready.\n\nI saw some results after the first treatment which was encouraging.  For the second treatment, I left a lecture early to get there on time...only to end up waiting 20 mins past my appointment time.  The girl was different and very sweet.  Again it was very quick and was painless.  I didn't notice much of a result though.\n\nThe third time was this week.  I was warned ahead of time that they had double booked accidentally and that she was running behind.  I wasn't actually waiting that long though.  I had a different girl again this time.   I'm really sorry I can't remember her name because she was excellent.   Friendly, very thorough and very dedicated to doing her job well.  She was generous with towels and made me feel comfortable.  She spent much longer on each area making absolutely sure every single bit had been covered.  It was more uncomfortable but I'd take that if it means it will actually work.  I know I'm paying a discount rate, but it's still not for free and if I get nothing out of it I'll be so cross!  I was thrilled to hear she's hoping to stay in the Yorkville location full time.  I would be infinitely happier with my treatment with her.   They were hovering at a 2 star until that treatment.\n\nI'm left with very mixed feelings.  After my first treatment I absolutely couldn't recommend the place to some friends (the ones with standards) because it seemed to be such a budget experience.  I didn't think they'd appreciate it!  My most recent experience was much better though so has dragged it up a little in my estimation.   I hope I have the same therapist again.  If I do I can recommend it freely.  For now, it's more of a watch this space....",

        "text": "Just couldn't join this gym, despite the proximity and a corporate discount.\n\nFirst, the positive things:\n-It's clean\n-It's pretty spacious\n-They have a range of cardio machine brands-mix of Life Fitness, Precor and Cybex.  I like Precor ellipticals best but prefer Life Fitness treadmills so this is good for me.\n\nI'm stuggling to think of anything else that I liked.  I wandered in because I'd been inundated with flyers in my post box from them but one actually looked promising-2 months at $10/month.  No obligation.  No long term contract.  Sounded good!  Obviously I expected it was too good to be true though.\nI happened to be passing one day so decided to pop in.  The girl at the desk said she knew nothing about such offers so I'd have to speak to the membership guy.  He walked out all fake smiles and joviality.  He decided that I was Australian after I'd uttered a couple of words-obviously wrong and didn't bother just asking me where I was from.  I asked him about the offer and he basically refused to tell me about it, mumbling something about it only being for the first 2 months of a 12 month contract.\n\nWe had to go on a tour of the gym then.  He took the elevator up one floor because he had hurt his back training.  In the gym.\n\nGood lot of cardio machines and it didn't seem that busy but was a Saturday lunchtime so hard to judge.  Some weight machines but scant free weights.  Saw a room for personal training which had the kettlebells and balls....for use with the personal trainers.  The changing room was nice.  The thing he seemed most proud of in the whole gym was the lounge and juice bar.  Honestly, in my opinion, this is the most pointless waste of space imaginable.  I want to go to the gym, do my workout and leave.  i can sit on my ass undoing my good work by drinking hundreds of calories at home or somewhere else.\n\nI was then brought to the office.  He took my details-scrawled down on a scrap of paper-and then started pushing me to join there and then.  I was repeatedly asked WHY I wouldn't join then.  I said I had to think about it.  But why not?  And on....  I had to invent somewhere I had to be to escape.  I said I'd prefer to try the gym first, but he'd only allow me a pass for sometime he was on duty.  I sprinted out the door.\n\nAt home later, after my fictitious important thing to do, I started Googling.  Turns out blog.to wrote about these tactics a couple of years ago and got 258 comments from dissatisfied people (http://www.blogto.com/sports_play/2008/05/extreme_fitness_extreme_ripoff/).  One of the big gripes was an inability to contact managers and/or head office.  I tried emailing the marketing division twice and got no reply.  I also checked the Better Business Bureau-they get a big fat F.  (http://www.bbb.org/kitchener/business-reviews/health-clubs/extreme-fitness-inc-ho-in-thornhill-on-1036564)\n\nAt the moment I'm doing a week's free trial at Goodlife.  Not half as fancy but has everything I want and they weren't at all as aggressive.  99% certain I'll be joining there.  Wouldn't touch this place.",

        "text": "Thanks to the fabulous Yelp, I got a Passport to Prana recently and have been scanning the list trying to decide where to go first.  I recently headed to Tula for my first yoga class in almost 3 years so was hoping I'd find somewhere that was challenging without expecting me to become a pretzel!  I read the reviews of 889 Yonge (and reckon Roma M is always a good judge of yoga places) so decided to pop in today to get the holiday weekend off to a good start.\nThis studio is GORGEOUS.  The staff at the desk were really friendly and full of smiles, I filled out the usual health form thing and headed off for my class.  I kind of wished they had given a few directions because I had to ask someone else where the changing rooms were after wandering aimlessly for a few minutes.   Turns out the changing areas are downstairs and are spotless with really restful feel and lockers that you don't have to bring a padlock for, showers and towels.  There's water and tea in a little lobby area downstairs.  The main floor has the reception desk, a little shop, mats and a new studio.  I was in the back studio upstairs.  There's a lovely waiting area with couches, water, tea and yoga books.  Really sweet things were a book to suggest music you like for yoga and a wishing wall-you write a wish on a piece of coloured paper, roll it up and pop it into a little slot :-)\nThe studio I was in was so pleasant.  The sun was streaming in the window and I was lucky that the Saturday brunch flow class I attended wasn't too crowded.  The instructor, Nicky, was just the sweetest person and came over to me before the class because she knew I was new.  She distributed blocks and straps and there were towels available in a shelving unit against one wall.  The class was great....started off with gentle somatic type movements and then headed into a good flow session.  I had forgotten how challenging yoga can be-it really demands a different type of strength to the gym-and I was reminded of how stiff and inflexible I've become!  Nicky gave excellent instructions, demonstrated and corrected gently.  I finished the class completely miles away in savasana...as relaxed as I would be after a facial or massage.\nOn the way out I had a nice cup of tea and the beaming girl at reception waved goodbye.\nI wish I had more money-yoga works out expensive (vs a regular gym membership for example)...but they have a selection of packages etc-e.g. 6 classes for $108 or monthly membership packages ranging from 4 classes a month for $68 to the kind of super deluxe package at $230/month which allows you unlimited yoga plus either a private session or a massage once a month.  Members also get 10% off at the boutique and wellness clinic.  The membership options are an autorenewal thing though so best if you are definitely going to be there regularly!  The current introductory special is $20 for 10 days unlimited yoga.  Pretty good value-especially considering the quality of the teaching.  And Jennifer K's description of the place as an oasis is utterly accurate.  It's bliss :-)\n\nI can't wait to go back!",

First of all, she practically deafened and frightened the crap out of me.  Secondly, I'm well past my teen years so I don't actually know what the proper response is to that question.  Is it rhetorical?  Is there an accepted response?  As it was I just sprinted away from her as quickly as I could, through the gloom to the stands which appeared to hold clothing.\n\nI wouldn't usually shop in here but I bought my little sister a Hollister hoodie for Christmas which she liked.  It was not a completely easy process-I found a tear in the logo when I brought it home so had to return it.  The girl on the desk said she thought it was meant to look like that.  Really?!?  Anyway,  it's now coming up to little sister's birthday so decided to revisit.  I popped in last week for a quick recon mission to see if anything looked gift-worthy.  I left soon after I found a couple of teens engaged in a make-out session at the back.  I think they may have become confused by the loud music and darkness and thought they were in a club?  They were completely oblivious to any shoppers anyway and the staff completely ignored them.\n\nI did manage to buy a top and dress for my little sister.  The dress is cute (even when I managed to see it in the light at home) and was on sale.  The top is also bright and comfy looking.  I'm sure she'll like them!  Service was pretty quick and with only mild fakeness.  I escaped alive and managed to speed past megaphone mouth greeter who yelled goodbye as I left.\n\n*Pros:  Some good reductions at times.  Much of the stuff is overpriced.\n             Doesn't stink as much as Abercrombie & Fitch\n             Bit cheaper than A&F (it would want to be-that place is crazy)\n\n*Cons: Scary greeters\n             It's practically pitch black in there.   Who knows what you're \n             actually buying?\n             Sizes are tiny-made for little high school girls who don't eat\n             Music is so loud!

        "text": "I've been trying to save money recently and was on the verge of painting my own toenails when my insight kicked in and I realized that my horrible feet needed more than a bit of polish to make them look like they belonged to a human being. I felt like a change from my usual place and Yelp threw up Yeti nails.\n\nSome of the reviews had mentioned it being busy at times so I tried emailing for an appointment. I was actually kind of surprised to get a response with the 6pm Saturday appointment I'd asked for. I love it when businesses are contactable by email! It makes my life so much easier.\n\nI arrived a little early but was taken straight away. The place is like your standard nail salon but is completely spotless. There's a wide range of colours-China Glaze, Essie etc and Shellac. Almost too much!  The massage chair gave my back a good going over while the technician got to work on my hooves. I have to give her credit for only frowning very slightly when she saw the state of them and instead just getting to work. She also didn't laugh at my tiny-nailed second toe. It's an affliction! There was a nice leg massage too, even as part of the standard pedicure.\n\nI wondered what one of the other reviews meant by them taking their time. Did it mean slow? It's actually the correct description. My technician wasn't slow but I never felt rushed, she was very gentle and completely meticulous with every bit of the pedicure. This was especially appreciated considering it was the end of the day and I'm sure they wanted to go home. \n\nI love how much nicer my toes look now and my feet feel better. It was definitely worth the $25 price tag. And the best thing? They were all just so incredibly lovely! Not chatty during the treatment while I read my book but full of warm smiles and just the perfect amount of talk around it. I'll definitely return!",

        "text": "Not sure how I missed this place before.  It's right in the downtown core.  I would have thought my cupcake locating spidey sense would have directed me here ages ago.  As it is, I just happened across it yesterday while wandering home.\n\nThe store is bright and eye-catching.  It's heavily girlie girl themed which isn't something I like too much.  I don't like it when people make it way too obvious that they're targeting me with their marketing.  I'd like to believe that I've made a conscious decision-even though I know that I haven't really.\n\nI arrived after 5pm and the shelves were looking fairly depleted.  The girl who served me was lovely though and managed to run through all the flavours they had left as if it was the first time that day, not the hundredth.  I decided on a chocolate peanut butter regular and a mini vanilla and lemon.  Total came to $5.31 after tax.  I loved the cute little box which kept it straight...although it didn't quite survive being shoved into my handbag and dragged around.  Not many things would.\n\nI liked them a lot!  The lemon was yummy and the mini size was perfect.  The chocolate peanut butter had a light and moist bun with a really well flavoured buttercream.  They are definitely sweet so if you usually go more for a cream cheese frosting and like some tartness, you probably won't like them.  I didn't notice any sugar particles though unlike a previous reviewer.  \n\nI'd like to go back to test more of them-especially since another reviewer mentioned that quality fluctuates depending on the flavour.  I especially want to try a red velvet or vanilla.  Think they're good tests of cupcake quality!  I didn't find the flavours boring really.  I'd describe them as more traditional or classic.  There's nothing wrong with that.  I think my ideal cupcakery is one that is based on classic flavours with a different special every now and then.\n\nSo, for now it's a cautious 4ish stars.  The final pronouncement will depend on red velvet and vanilla quality.  Try not to let the suspense bother you too much!",

And fruit) and that it can get a bit crowded on summer evenings. It's in a great location for passing business.",

We managed to get a reservation during the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and only booked a few weeks before. We did pay a premium over the normal rate but given the crowds in the city during this time, it was still a good deal compared to other hotels.\n\nStaff were all friendly and welcoming, presentable and professional.\nWe received a room upgrade with quite a large room overlooking the bridge crossing Waverley station to Princes St. Despite overlooking a busy road, the room was almost silent thanks to solid double glazing. The room temperature was perfectly controlled with an individual A/C unit. Super clean, modern, uncluttered. Bathroom was similar. No slamming doors or noise in the night. Bonus.\n\nFree wifi that works with one log in (doesn't require repeated log ins as some places do) and had decent signal strength.\n\nThe buffet continental breakfast was also a hit with fresh croissants, danishes, cold cuts, cheese, toast, fruit and yoghurt all well presented, fresh and good quality as was the coffee.\n\nIf I am looking for a reasonable hotel in a city, Motel One will be by first choice.",

We asked for the breakfast pancakes that were on the blackboard but were told it would take a while accompanied by a pained look as if we were asking for something outlandish so not wanting to put them out, we settled instead for a croissant with the coffee but had to wait about 10 minutes before they brought over with the coffee. No napkin. I noticed the people on the table opposite had to get their own cutlery. \n\nCoffee was good. Afterwards we waited a few further minutes to pay as they took the order first from someone else who stepped in front of us at the counter so didn't return the next day.",

You can make your own combination.\nMost importantly, the food itself is excellent. Perfect basmati rice with some aromatics. I recommend the aubergine and pepper curry, meltingly soft and delicious as well as the channa and dahl. The standard chicken curry is also excellent with super tender chicken. Add ons include samosas and naan bread and probably some other options.\n\nFood is served at the counter, you pay, take your plate and find a seat with the other diners.\n\nWe had lunch there every day and wish I had a branch near me. I've been trying to make my own versions of their curries, inspired as I was. Not bad but can't come close.\n\nA perfect no-nonsense, no pretence, no fuss, great food and great value eatery.",

Motel1One is nearby and a easy two minute walk, slightly uphill towards the castle from the station. \n\nOn entry it's modern, cosy has tons of cool yet bright pastel and mochilato colours to accommodate your cold wintertime self. Wooden floors, warm rugs, sheepskins on the sofas, slate walls and oak barrelled tables, with slight distinct Scottish themes due to their tartan furnished accessories completes the feel.\n\nI sat in One Lounge, had tea and food self served for well under £10, you know bran, meats cheese and croissant that sort of stuff. With a copy of local newspaper in hand I really needed to eat, stay warm and access wifi, the reasons I came in.\n\nSome hotels in the city give you access to wifi if your a paying guest, but repeated attempts to access their wifi even with staff help, eventually gave access but in German. On going to reception again for additional help the staff were great got the correct website for me, but still no luck.\n\nHmmm, by the time this was all done I came back to cold tea and didn't really have time now to finish a second cup of hot Earl Grey, so sorry to staff for removing an almost full cup of tea. Great place though nice breakfast and funky decor especially the plasma tv displaying a roasting log fire in reception, but sadly for me no easy access to wifi when badly required.\n\nMaybe next time I will endeavour to try food against technology!",

After quizzing staff on this we found out the reason it was a sunny day and everyone would be in the Meadows eating sausages or pizza, but they were booked heavily for later on. So we had choice of any table, and had the whole restaurant to ourselves, it defo wasn't a crowded house.\n\nToo warm to drink beer, which they don't  have anyway(only soft drinks), we were offered bottles of chilled still water, but had also brought our own bottle. A short time later, some food arrived, so found out the washrooms were downstairs, knowing when I got back the remainder of food would be there. \n\nVenturing into the basement was like there had previously been the perfectly cool wine cellar or old bank with plenty places to store that precious metal or paper currency?\n\nThere was three of us at Leven Street's Tuk Tuk, and they managed to satisfy our hunger pangs with lots of small variations of lamb and chickeny portions such as Chook Lollipops(tandoori style), Butter Chooks, Bun Chook Kebabs with salad leafs and Patina Lamb, that were all complimented with a variety of spicy & mint dips, in addition to rice and fries.\n\nTo give them four possibly five stars would be for creating an golden authentic styled establishment, not bowing to an inclusive mixture of other cuisines; seven dam-fine flavours and cost for three happy excited campers £25-ish.\n\nThe place is bright and quite comfortable to plant your derrière, and has Bollywood styled music to complete that Indian feeling, but simply another great 2 month old toddler that Tollcross has to offered the good folks of Edinburgh...makes me start to wonder is this now the gastronomic area of the city?\n\nSee ya soon Tuk Tuk, for another great afternoon!?",

Go if you like large pools, warm water(solar heated), diving, fitness group classes, birthday parties(soft play rooms) and cafe. Also TRCP has 2 Car Parks. \n\nDuncan Goodhew will still be proud!

Stands a few stories high, is brown brick coloured and occupies one side of Festival Square, but will have everything you need within or nearby.\n\nRecently refitted with alternate layout, so if the last time you visited the city a year or so then it's a whole lot different! There is no piano bar, no long corridor to walk to reach the main bar; everything is mostly around the entrance, mostly. At the back where the piano bar was is for functions and strictly a guests only area. \n\nThe bar to the right of entrance (left is restaurant) is where I decided to have a quick bite and non-alcohol drink before work. Usually when friends go on vacation, every summer if I stay/work in Edina make the effort to find another fresh establishment when listening to or reading about their holiday stories; it almost makes up for the stay-cation!\n\nThe Sheraton bar however hits all the right buttons, from easy listening music, to the low lighting, soft natural finishes to furnishing; high backed green seats, upturned goldfish bowls on ceiling as lighting feature. Excellent service, but yes there is a but! The attention to detail in food presentation for me is lower than 5 stars. \n\nAfter discovered something unsavoury lurking at the bottom of the metal canister the fries were contained in. Please Sheraton if you feel the need to include things alternate to food then please alert customers before-hand, and simply give things a clean/check over before serving food in them! \n\nOn alerting staff to the extra article contained, the response was to apologise, throw the article to the floor and carry on as usual. Yes I did mostly enjoy my experience and I will be keeping an eye out for winged creatures next visit so I can utter the words \"waiter, there's a...\"",

Found a seat just outside, as was busy with a bridal party.\n\nThe menu states La tasca food to share, I thought really for me its enough for one; why share four prawns, (Gambas Gabardina Madrid), king prawns in San Migel beer batter, with mayo of garlic & paprika. Ordered these as I had plenty time before a film. The offer emailed to me this week, mentioned free coffee if ordering from their dessert menu. decided their dessert Spanish cheese board it looked appealing.\n\nContaining blue, tetilla, manchego and goats cheese(among my favourites), and served with a crunchy sugar coated tort, fresh apple and quince paste...mmmm oh yes, good start to the weekend I thought as I tucked in. But I needed to email someone, so tried to access wifi. Was it free or was a password was required?\n\nManagement was quite pleasant and had a chat with him about how his chain was doing with the competition around, and if there was wifi available. He told me La Tasca recommends you use The Cloud, simply put name and password into site through Google, and your off, but with no connection or dedicated site to use, simple to access I hear you say; Hmmm?\n\nIt would have been easier if...id asked for a rabbit in a hat with a bat, as tried for about half hour to access any wifi(there are a few) but no luck on any. Possibly due to being too far from hub in question. Previous experience has taught me faint signal + ancient laptop = not a good combo, this has occurred before in other foodie places around town. \n\nMy hour was up so asked for the bill from staff at the bar, but was beckoned to wait until another staff member who worked at the food till could ring up my order. \n\nGuess what, she didn't notice that I'd had dessert, and there was no notification on the bill to state discounted coffee with dessert as promised, so I queried this!\n\nShe rectified the problem after a few minutes, strangely discounting an odd amount from the order, I didn't have time to discuss it further but as the total was around £10, decided on tipping and then left. Moral check your bill b4 always...\n\nThe food was fine, coffee quite strong for a small cup, though not paint stripper strength, but you could taste a kind of espresso milky quality. The service was fantastically quick.\n\nBut what lets La T down is the comms between you, staff, bill and emails(of which there are probably many every week), thus trying to explain this to all involved. Oh yeah and not getting access to the web was a minus for me.\n\nSo three stars from me until all is resolved, but four stars for the menu.",

Really do nice cakes make up for the gapping chasm of friendliness and passion that used to lure me back week upon week; I think not!

Enriched by people who can get together and enjoy the mall experience, a place where community decisions matter, a place that produces job creation for the local economy?\n\nYes you could be a mall rat, but one where you partially hang about outside, as it is such a large spread out site you kind of stay healthy, walking the distance between shops. Sadly what we dont want to see is Fort Kinnaird snapped out of existence to be no more, like a slain king in battle, now virtually buried to become a car park. \n\nThere's light on the horizon and word of another cinema complex going ahead here, just don't invite Justin Bieber to open it, even if his street cred needs enhancing!",

I asked for it to be quickly blasted with some kind of heat, that done it was fine, no worries!? Not salty either (another gripe of mine), but it was tasty.\n\nStaff helped with wobbly table and straightened it with technical cardboard, so I was happy with that as needed to work.

I kind of thought they used to have a varied connection here?\n\nWith the chocolate moose cake arrival, which I must say was delightful looking and so easy to eat whipped up so soft and light (more pls), coupled with soy cappuccino was great. I quizzed staff on what happened to wifi and if VHugo still had its own dedicated wifi. No idea was the reply and would check, but guess what - never came back to me.\n\nSo minuses for no wifi, another for staff not getting back to me, plus another for resurrection of cold soup, after making a fuss.

To my last show in 2012 to listen to a couple of guys whom played piano and told a story of their lifestyle and upbringing whilst learning to play an instrument from an early age...to the recent play \"Translations\".\n\nSet in an Irish school, in 1833, it sets the scene the British Army tasked to translate place names from ancient Irish Gaelic to the King's English.\n\nOwen, brother teacher Manus, returns after period in Dublin, acting as translator and go-between for the British and Irish, a love triangle between Yolland, Manus, and a local woman, Máire, complicates things?\n\nDirected by acclaimed actor and director, Adrian Dunbar. Translations was the first production by Field Day Theatre Company founded by Tony Award Winner Friel and Stephen Rea, is creatively produced play from one of the greatest living English-language dramatists. \n\nQuite frankly sitting in an art deco styled theatre such as the refurb'd Kings, you could be forgiven for thinking you were in London's Soho/theatre district; both places should be twinned and adorned by Luvvies alike for sheer exuberance.\n\nEdina is so lucky to have a real theatre that had it's ups and downs over the years, and lucky me for getting a chance to see this one...recommended to all who like a good \"Ménage à trois\", a few laughs and possibly tears!  \n\nEven nowadays people daily don't dress like they do in this play anymore, but if you like period costume and have a hunger to see, these cossys, but not in a museum then you may have missed your chance, for now!\n\n4 stars, five if they were to reduce the price of G&T's, gets my thumbs up!",

New menus daily, wow...chef is really good at his job, fresh bright food, locally sourced; find out more amazing passionate food combos from their website.\n\nWe tried Haddock and Salmon dishes, they were supported by variations of potatoes, blanched asparagus, but the chef satisfied the buttery hollandaise sauce complimenting the salmon wasn't up to standards had more brought out, not sure why he didn't notice this before it was presented, but hey it's his creation so why grump it was still devine. Not content with the main my friend who lives out of hotels due to business connections managed to easily scoff profiteroles with chocolate sauce and a latte.\n\nDesert menu chalkboard is in their other dinning room, so has to be brought through and placed nearby to read. It was after 8pm but was unsure if the desserts change then? Service was top notch and worth it's double AA rating, bringing Ducks to the forefront of luxury dining in East Lothian. Around £40 for two mains, a dessert, coffee and two beers, didn't break the bank as I wasn't paying all the better!\n\nCertainly, I will go back to Ducks but next year, and possibly sooner to their Edinburgh venue to see how it compares?",

Though even going to the main food area it all seemed a little unappealing and depressed looking. Things might improve earlier, or on other days, but doesn't really make me want to go back again if the best combo I saw was soup and a sandwich! Definitely not the foodie place to wave a flag about, probably due to the many other food establishments under one roof?\n\nValue for money for two sandwiches, soup, earl grey tea, glass of fizz; ok for around £10. Quick service and ambience, fine. This was afterall lunchtime mid week so it's incredibly quiet and feels like sitting in a very big space with large windows, out of which there is a view of working vessels, and new housing across the harbour area.\n  \nThe appeal factor here is, there isn't many differences in Ocean Terminal shopping that you wouldn't find scattered around centre of town; just more compact. We visited Fat Face, The Whiskey Shop, O2 and HMV(10% discount on goods). There are still a few sales ongoing, however we didn't have much time to go into any others.\n\nThere are a few touristy ventures to go on here such as a tour of Britannia, and a soup shop from Baxter's, Pure Gyms, Vue cinema chain is here also with up to date flicks and sometimes special previews. Vast parking area also, not sure if it's free though?\n\nIn all it's great if you have an agenda, not so good for some food choices, but shop around as there are a few better eateries within ten-minute walk. Above all Ocean is comfortable, warm and ambient place to chilax for a short time if your in the area",

But don't tell everyone you know that it's really quiet compared to the east end of the city so not too busy.  \n\nIs spacious and cool, has tons of antique focal points such as upholstered seats made from recycled tweed jackets others with green leather, the choice of tables - resemble the kind your great gran might have owned.\n\nAt two weeks old FYUL has a constant flow of people dropping in on their way to festival shows, so it seems to be doing fine. With plenty of room to swing ten cats there are no shortage of seats to accommodate large groups as well as intimate chat.\n\nThe staff are very attentive, striving to ring true their passionate message of being the best cafe in town. However with some competition, they have their work cut out; so with great responsibility comes even greater power.\n\nCoconut Tea and Lemon Drizzle Cake, were popular today as were salads with locally sourced breads. None of which I had this time but hey there is the challenge, maybe not tomorrow but sometime soon. \n\nFinishing touches to the place include, large bar area, Singer sewing machines, Remington typewriters, suitcases and tv/stereo box combos all from a bygone era culminate to stylise the cafe. One thing that did make me wonder, what's beyond the door positioned at strange angles on the wall, and what school gym now has no floor?\n\nAnyhoo the service was top-notch, scones not stogie and came with fresh cream, fine coffee(V60's) all made this a truly  fantastic experience during a shopping trip well earned and such a surprise to stumble upon FYUL in this great city; go on treat yourself you deserve it?!\n\nSo appealing enough to walk past, turn around, and venture in, maybe you will really like it or not? But if you are young enough to remember the 50's or not then it will appeal. If not then just pretend you've gone through a time portal, and came out the other side 65 years ago!\n\nIn all a hip place, with enough power that made me want to stay longer than the half hour I did.",

Like adding garnish to a main meal  the new shell, interior fixtures and fittings are surely fit for another royal visit...surely? \n\nBut the re-creatation shows off this really nice building, which is crafted well from the outside, and gives the interior a glam-stylish(glam-ish) interior, no forgetting intising new cafe/foodie venue. \n\nAs we didn't have time during the latest show interval for a meal, we all had some coffee and marsh mallows instead...worked a treat! But will book before next time here, just hope that as its a venue for many types of visitors, the food and drink is locally sourced, and not too expensive?\n\nCanadian singer Sarah McLaughlan, BBC Bang Goes The Theory, legendary Billy Connolly, Hue & Cry(are they still going?) are some of the players I've seen here over the years, but all experiences were well before or after the structural incident!\n\nI've sat in various places around the auditorium, always in a diffent seat, with mixed results. The worst for sound clarity was in the stalls at the end of an aisle about row five to ten to the left, on the plus side much leg room.\n\nFor me the usual way to aquire show tickets is don't bother with websites that will inflate prices by abusing your wallet for card use, just get to the hall itself as they will usually sell tickets even when websites may tell you otherwise and you get to speak to people not an answer machine. \n\nIve also heard there are a multitude of passageways and rooms in the basement(is it haunted I hear you ask...I dont know!) but maybe there is a tour that covers seeking the phantom of the hall, or as it would be known in Edinburgh as the gooley...you guys!\n\nBut as other Yelpers like Claire L.mention just go for the theatre experience or as Claire C. tells it; live music?

Upon asking if it was possible to just order a coffee I was asked to come in. While I didn't have time for a bite to eat the coffee did the job and heated me up, also included there was a small biscuit which sufficed the hunger...temporarily. I also ordered from their small range of cakes, shortcake complimenting the coffee well.\n\nSitting down on comfy leather seating and tables that hugged each wall of an \"L-shaped room\", ordered a white coffee and scoped the surroundings. Wooden flooring, coupled with mocha and cream/white finish on the walls - with additional water feature on the wall near the door, 3D styled curvey white ceiling, completed with snaking multi coloured neon lighting, the ambience made me feel comfortable.\n\nDesigned with attention to detail in mind, little alcoves dotted around are filled with flora, giving a distinct Mediterranean feel overall. Also they have free wifi so excellent for work, but didn't see any power-points for connecting laptops, maybe they are hidden? Ask behind the bar for password, but its easy to connect.\n\nWord on the street is it's great food and chat with staff - this comes from friends and family who enjoy going there. So ultimately for me that is a calling card for a repeat visit but for booking an evening meal. But I do need to remember to pack cash as they don't yet have any form of card payment; hope this gets sorted soon?\n\n3 stars for all above but when full review of meals completed and payment by card sorted this may change?",

A short time later...Oh my, you need to go and try the combo of pancakes (yes six small ones), maple syrup, honey, fresh cream were solidly devine, and mouth meltingly good, Thanks Tanja.\n\nAs I gazed around, on the walls hung street scene pictures of some cosmopolitan city, And looking around the caffe it almost has a distinct European quality about it clean, well presented seating and staff very friendly.\n\nMy new found spring clean is to try as many green teas in as many places as possible the city can offer me in a week. That really got off to a great start at Brew Lab, the presentation of fresh looking leaves in a transparent pot, but here was a small portion of tea in a bag.

I had no choice(really I didn't) to treat myself to a takeaway cup of latte type blend as the rest of Edinburgh folks were there. Obviously they, like Carrie in SATC who knows shoes, the chaps in here must know what's great coffee?\n\nOn my next visit me thinks I will either try first thing in the morning or last orders to possibly get a comfy seat. The only thing is since I'm new to trying Brew Lab; and it's decent enough to merit a second visit, is what regular who's seat I might sit on will be left out in the dark. Perhaps I could ponder this as I enjoy the smell, taste and texture of my next latte, green tea or earl grey hot. In all nice place guys but you need to make it bigger on the inside!",

The food is very tasty if not on the tad expensive side with reduced quantities, this is due to the Hotel changing menus and name. Used to be a Hilton is now a Waldorf.

There are plenty seats and tables for working on, newspaper availability, and its quiet. Well background Classical music verbiates around the vast space.\n\nWith style and pleasant surroundings to work on your own or for meet-ups, it is a central location, and would favour shoppers, tourists and business types alike.\n\nChances are if you are not busy and you want to treat yourself, or someone else infact then break the ground rules of going to Starbucks; or go after Starbucks closes and you might find yourself with reduced bank balance but an immensely  happy camper. \n\nOh did I forget they also have divine shortbread in addition to tea/coffee, and free wifi to residents of the hotel only...but ask for connection details to Paul or his staff and be rewarded...or not.\n\nThe feeling of being here reminds me of a grand station hall, but maybe that's just me, however still go if you have time to spare whilst waiting on your train.",

Great service, cosy surroundings, soft music, generous portions made our tapas styled meal all the more authentic. Very tasty and lovely presented food, interesting decor and great company all made for a unique lunch experience.\n\nOn arrival we were presented with a sample of house white wine and a small portion of Parmesan paste coupled with cheese crunch. A short time later after more catching up our group demolished a selection of veggie goats cheese bruschetta, mushrooms, ham and cheese platter. We had so much fun during lunch that an hour just flew by.\n\nTwinned with their Italian sister opened around a decade ago on the East Coast of Italy, the team are providing authentic simplistic in style but delicious food combos with the exception of a menu without pizza.\n\nGo and try for yourself as there are plenty tables for medium sized groups (table share), or romantic night out. I will have to come back again of course to try their macaroni Italian cheese pasta(made in-house) or some of their fish dishes. \n\nThe restaurant however was quiet when we were in, over the coming weeks I'm sure they will be peppered with pre-event bookings. But in all another decent Italian establishment to add to the culinary delights in our great city.",

Well all pleasantly done at the annual Edinburgh Book Festival in Charlotte Square Gardens of course.\n\nWhat you will find is tents large enough to protect you come whatever weather Edina throws. There is something for every \"bookie\" here. Ice cream if it's warm and sunny, plenty seating, coffee/bar, kids and adults book events, author signing book area, disabled access, music and festival frollicks, oh yes and books...lots of 'em.\n\nAt brekfast, lunchtime or evening, sitting reading that newly purchased paperbook, while slurping a coffee, eating cake and doing occasional author spotting seems to enlighten the mood for some. However authors beware; paparazzi abound eager to snap that unlucky moment if you let them.\n\nReal care and attention is rendered here, for three weeks in August it's currently non digital, but who knows what Kindle fashionistas have in mind for the surreptitiouse evolution the digital age brings. Some might say books are dusty, bulky and simply not practical therefore being out of date, like Betamax, videobars, Lp's or Cd's. \n\nBringing some balance is this event where for a few weeks you can go nuts, buy as many books as you can carry, for yourself or those relatives for Xmas. But I for one much prefer purchasing paper copies, as page turning isn't the same reading from a screen. But don't take my word for it get yourself along there soon!",

The reply from reception was yes you can get coffee, but you have to go through to the restaurant entrance and talk to staff waiting there, so off I toddled happy that I would soon be wrapped up in a caffeine induced buzz.\n\nA swift order and I then sat down in their swish bright contemporary but mood lit lounge area, yes I know; mood lighting in the morning...perhaps it's to help weary travellers wake up! Predominantly containing a large bar with TV, large windows to view the world from, or to see you bus pass as you sip another cocktail, equally large paintings, interesting seating and what looks like cool food(but the jury is still out on that one until sampled)?\n\nThis is a comfortably setting, one which I would frequent again for an evening book read and pint, or early morning breakfast/coffee, so great location for a number of reasons. It's close to transport links, buses to airport, Waverley rail station. Within distance of shopping mile in Edinburgh and tourist attractions.

Did I get my wish, you bet I did!  I was ready to engage the gastronomic surrounds of a bright yet cosy and traditional French restaurant. The task in hand along with other Yelpers was to experience how this restaurant typifies the French culinary delights you might find in the city.\n\nThe eatery situated between a couple of rooms at the top of a stair, minimalistic and eventually candlelit was busy pretty much from early on, with enough heads at tables to keep the place quite warm. Coats are removed upon entry; nice touch, and warm focus rests on each group of guests, with enchanting comments from staff to restore faith in the human appetite by addition of impeccable hospitality(even if they don't enforce drinks menu).\n\nBut, yes there is a but. The room we were in balanced on the precarious edge of acoustic design, did made it difficult to hear what others were saying sitting opposite me. As with quite large and lively groups we were not rowdy but having a fun time, so apologies to other guests who wanted a quiet or romantic dinner, and to fellow Yelpers if I didn't carry the conversation.\n\nLes Entrees for me were Artisan cheese parcels with a selection of dips. Red wine would have gone well with this, but since I wasn't drinking on this occasion these were still palatable without. Accompanied by truffle aperitif that I found quite bitter, bread and delectable salmon bites, which were quite tasty but very buttery. Les Plats was Sea bass with steamed mash(slightly over seasoned due to the fishy brandy bisque), followed by Les Dessert option being Herve Mons artisan cheese platter(2 cheese chunks, one of which I never did find out the name of, coupled with 1 oatcake).\n\nIn all I was encompassed in strong French emphasis from the moment I stepped in. So hats tipped in the direction of a lugubrious team of chefs, maitre d types and waitress's whom without wouldn't have made the evening so charmed.\n\nWhat would have been even better is if they add their own motivated sommeliers or wine directors then maybe some of the queries they got from us would been reduced. Edinburgh has it's fair share of good bars, but quality restaurant wine list access should, like the wine improve with age, to a point that makes an exciting stance.\n\nI for one, when coming back would settle for nothing less than a table at L'escargo Blanc looking up towards the castle. Again endless thanks  to our CM who organised this event, most certainly did their homework for a fantastic xmas night out.",

I first became aware of them at Yelp's Winter Wonderland in December, where I had a chat with the owner while sampling some chocolate - but why has it taken nearly half a year to venture in?\n\nReason is, it was usually booked out mostly every-time I walked past, so today made an executive decision to get a coffee here no matter what and sample more delicious sugary chocolate things and to savour their cool light and awesomely casual place.\n\nWith luck a table was available so never needed to book, also around 2pm missed the mass lunchers and most yum-mums so upon seated look around to activate all five senses. Jazz music playing - a treat for the ears, coffee smells for the nose, coupled with choc tastes, the feel of the place is homely and definitely not rushed, and you'll be in a pickle to look at what chocolates to take away.\n\nWith fantastic ace customer attention and being wifi enabled, I set about some work and was soon off again on another Cappuccino and Cake-ville adventure. But cor-blimey nothing had prepare me for the velvety smooth texture of the Rum Truffle slice o' cake(gf) against the slight bitter coffee taste. Each complimented the other perfectly so as a result this was my new favourite discovered place of the week!\n\nYou'll find they have framed pictures relating to items sold, but one very large pic opposite the till, if you look close enough is actually a jigsaw; wondered how long that took to make? Adorning other walls are shelves of cups and other products but couldn't buy them just now as didn't have anymore arms to carry stuff...but that's what you get for walking back from the bank in Morningside; many many shops!\n\nIf the wifi isn't working just get nice staff to reset it, hopefully you will get access, it worked for me. I also was allowed to sit for a fair while as it wasn't really busy mid afternoon.\n\nBut apologies to staff for being a student and not tipping kind staff this time. My reason was cake slice looked awesome cost more than I had in cash, so had to use card; promises to make up for it on next visit!\n\nIn all go if you want to experience one of Edinburgh's hot places on the coffee scene.",

Oh yes while I nearly forgot to note - take cash next time as their card machine sometimes throws a hissy fit.\n\nAt the end of the day, they don't supply a bad service, but a great big happy one with icing on top plus they have the components in place for repeat custom. One thing I did notice on searching for Looking Glass Books on internet, their namesake in the US cropped up - and it has or had a resident cat that sleeps by a fireplace.\n\nPlease oh please LGB don't get a cat, or far worse a fireplace!",

I was looking to cover marks and a one litre tin was the target size to do the job. A quick chat to knowledgeable staff gave me a couple of options, buy lots of tester pots(of which there were not a lot of the colour I required available in store) or get a slightly larger tin than tester size, then simply mix in the colours from their automated machine to get the desired result.\n\nI have seen these gelato type paint devices in DIY stores before but never before used them. A squirt of three blends into white, a forty second swirl, and hey presto mellow mocha flavour. It kinda reminded me of the Brew Dog chaps making a fab coffee only quicker. I even got a strip of lining paper painted from my tin to compare the sample in hand, quite close colour match. So I got exactly what I asked for in a tin.\n\nOnly one gripe with Homebase is that I also needed to buy some furniture that was in their sale and get it delivered; so could they do home delivery? Nada, nope can't do that as they don't currently have a driver. An employment avenue for someone there me thinks? So it's off the google machine again to order furnishings online. The thing is should I wait a few more weeks and maybe it will reduce in price even more, hmmmm?\n\nIn all got mostly what I wanted and received points on the Nectar card also, cheers Homebase.",

But with minimum competition; ok, perhaps a couple of places that might cater to similar style as this place nearby, I felt duty bound to find out if they were the best in the area, my luck was in early June.\n\nThe party I was invited to had actually won the entire wedding through a local Haddington newspaper. Well almost, they still have to iron out some creases, but hey when weddings cost as they certainly do, then it really pays to get this on. So thanks to the Courier as the organiser!\n\nThe decor inside the Quayside is dark wood, deep pile red-ish carpets, in and around the small bar downstairs, but past reception is their restaurant. Another bar upstairs on first floor and another on level 2. There is a lift for people that don't fancy or can't do the walk, but it's not that quick!\n\nWith adequate parking to the rear and side of the venue overlooking the harbour, it really pays to park as close to the venue as possible, especially as it rained heavily on the day in question, so it kind of ruined those precious wedding photos!\n\nWedding food was faultless but was it really that price(£75each according to the Bride's father), but we did get champs upon reception. Red and White wine with the dinner, roast chicken and haggis tower was a treat, as was choco pudding and cream (in the shape of a heart). With all that booze flowing some of our party later on just wanted a cup of tea, so when I requested this, the staff couldn't have been more accommodating, so top marks for producing a pot or two when they didn't really have to!\n\nFood booking drinks ambience were great, but you need three rules. 1. some ill placed seating meant my back was to the bridal table during speeches. To any future brides out there, save guests having a crick in the neck, check the table layout. 2. To make your perfect wedding even better, please get a band. 3. With reception closed well before 1am also make sure you prebook a taxi or this may incur a lengthy wait at the nearest taxi rank or bus stop.\n\nSpeaking of food, Quayside renamed their restaurant as the \"World Buffet\",(does exactly as is says). The name conjures up horrors of many a fast food joint. But with many foods available (and I did ask what they didn't produce) to which the answer was - no to fruit. But I ask you, after unlimited buffet food not many peeps will have room for fruit anyhow?\n\nRequiring another visit to experience since I was there for a wedding so couldn't appreciate this mass buffet experience. My mission should I choose to accept it is to find out, but if  the wedding food was anything to go by, they'll probably be ok???\n\nWorld Banq, musselburgh - One place many cuisines, all for £8.50, you try you decide?",

No problem it shall be done, we said to the manager.\n\nService very friendly, chatty staff but service was quick, as they needed the table it was like service for us was in rush mode, enabling the food to be prepared, delivered and scoffed. That being said undue care was slightly at play with the texture and taste of some dishes.\n\nCalamari was slightly rubbery but otherwise ok and came with a salad, Tagliatelle Papilio was their special so obviously I had to give it a go since it was our first visit. Other members of our party had chicken stuffed with spinach, with accompanied veggies and a very very heavy balsamic vinegary sauce. As we were sharing samples, for me it kind of spoilt the dish that veggies with the chooks were drowning in salt, so sharing meant it kind of spoiled that dish for me and didn't eat a lot of it. A fine pizza-margarita completed the quadrant of plates.\n\nAmbience and friendliness of staff were second to none, fussing over us not just because someone else required the table, but what I witnessed was their manner with all guests. If Papilio's was the trend at the moment then I guess more folks would venture out to experience the face yoga that comes with the sounds made when the food arrives. \n\nFans of Italian restaurants in Edinburgh should be happy that I would recommend coming here even if it's just for an afternoon coffee with a group of friends, but especially for evening meal make sure you book and leave enough time for coffee or finishing that bottle of wine.\n\nTo get a healthy glow from smiling at the happiness inside a room, even with its slight flaw we experienced, I can't wait for the next time.",

Found a little way from the shops on Princes Street its one fantastic starting point for your day exploring the city. \n\nOpen daily after 8am til 6pm, Sat 10am til 6pm, closed on Sundays. they have lots of flavours to try and have nice city views also if you sit at a window seat. Some tables are booked during busy times but if you are a small party then no need to worry as there is ample table space, otherwise book ahead. Cafe Musa is open a lot later during Edinburgh Festival if I remember right from last year, was still sitting there at midnight!\n\nIf you dont believe me then take a look at other Yelps. Alisa R reckons the tea for two is a grand deal, and Jackie D explored it mid-way to the Castle, Blythe R mentions it has to be a good neighbour to the variety of competition nearby, while TripAdvisor reviews deem it \"perfectly adequate, especially if you manage to combine use of an Itison voucher.\"\n\nMy take is its got wifi, is not too noisy even during the busy Edinburgh Fringe, has big enough tables to work at, is bright and cool enough not just in a casual hip sort of way but not stuffy with dead air spaces. Their small amount of friendly staff do take the time to know your name, and will fill a thermos of coffee for your needs when they dont really need to. Soup is provided, as is friendly smiles and chat when Edinburgh has its coldest days, cool drinks for children or adults on its warmest. \n\nThere is also a kids play area but I've never really seen it used, around which are positioned large comfy sofas. Like the tv show Black Books don't let your children sit on them, they are so large you might loose one down the back? \n\nCafe Musa can tailor to most tastes, stocks Illy coffee, soups, are products Gluten free, need to find out on next visit, and their prices are not too damaging to your purse/wallet. \n\nAt just under a tenner will probably get you sandwiches, soup and coffee plus cake(TBC)\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can have Breakfast at Tiffanys, then why not have lunch at Cafe Musa?",

It's taken five weeks but on the way to the rail station, I found Scoobys.\n\nIts situated across from the Conference Centre on Morrison Street, and happy to report there are not only genuinely pleasant cheery folks here, but their prices are amazing too. They have been on the go for 13 years, and the best thing is, they are open a heck earlier than most in town which also means I can have breakfast before I get home at a reasonable hour, and at a price that won't break many banknotes.\n\nCosy but large enough counter to wait by as your beverage is carefully constructed,  it also seems food prices approximately start around £1.50 for a filled roll, with the bread being sourced locally too. They've been waiting for me for 13 years...and I can say it was worth it, but hey don't do the same get yourself down there just for the banter.",

        "text": "So since it's initial conception around ten years ago, the Edinburgh Trams are up and running, bringing me this morning from the airport into town. It's been a couple of days since startup at the end of May 2014, and some five months since training began for tram staff.\n\nThey persuade you to buy a ticket before boarding from automated ticket vendors at each stop and it seems prices are £1.50 for a single trip, though not sure if you can pay once on-board without a ticket. I only had to wait 5-7 minutes between one tram and the next. On boarding and as I look around the carriages only one other person had joined this journey; well it was quite early(6am) after all and peak hour was a while away. \n\nThe good folks of Edinburgh have endured years of 'when are they running' and 'not more tram related roadwork-questions'. They are of course outraged it's taken so long for the network to pick you up. The people of Edinburgh stated for a long time you'll have more chance of getting on a spaceship, than the trams being finished. They were constantly mocking the idea as another big white elephant, thus the trams stayed firm until late Springtime.\n\nOn the half hour journey into city centre from airport you will get the best views of the castle and gardens when you sit or stand on the right hand side. If you require more info on tram usage, local transport hub seems to be on the corner of Market Street/Waverley Bridge. Locals, visitors and tourists should obtain tickets from machines or try their website(Transport for Edinburgh). There is even a phone app you can use with android.\n\nOne thing though on some seating there isn't a lot of legroom but there are plenty displays telling you which stop is approaching, clean smelling, fantastic looking, quite comfortable with slight bumps as you travel just like a train would. The only flaw I found was it felt a bit claustrophobic, and the automated destination voice named stops in the wrong order, stations we'd just left as the arrival stop for the entire journey; this would no doubt confuse tourists. Will they be successful or not it seems only time will tell if the turnover will outweigh the cost. So it seems Edinburgh trams are most definitely here to stay with future track laying to the South-side and possibly Leith being planned now?",

So set about trying to locate one within the city that would suit. \n\nFinally landing on one that looked like it might do what it says on the tin I opted for Nuffield Health. As I never knew there was a sports centre this far west in town and it was in my bus route, naturally it was the best choice.\n\nI hadn't officially started working out this year, as running up and down stairs at work doesn't really count, I jumped at the chance not only get back to the gym, but also to review what a session at Nuffield Health is like?\n\nTime spent in reception upon arrival was definitely shorter than at my last keep fit place a few years ago at Virgin. So in one way this gives you less time sitting about discussing the unique selling points of the centre, filling out paperwork and getting to know them, when sometimes all you want is to feel the burn.\n\nIt has a 12 point MOT that recommends you don't proceed with if you have eaten before or done any form of exercise, so I'll have to book that for another week; and it all sounds quite rigorous?\n\nThe facilities and layout are great not to squished like my local gym in Tranent, but  good enough for constant turnover in the two hours I was there. All the equipment worked, also there just the right amount of people in each of the two large workout rooms located at the top of the stairs to not make me wait at all, and keep the sweat on so's not cool down much.\n\n1/2 day for some of the classes at weekends so didn't see what they were like. The quiet pool on arrival was fully stocked when the now burnt out shell of mine was in need if some h2O relief, so opted out of this; deciding instead to try out the food facilities.\n\nWithin 5 minutes I was enjoying a Berry Smoothy, Cajan Chicken Wrap and Coffee(approx. £10). The Smoothy was icy cool and slightly tart, coffee was Costa type, watery and warm. The chicken wrap was my second choice as they did not make any pasta chicken, which I prefer after a workout) but mild spicy it came with a green and mixed pepper salad, complimented with a nicely balanced vinegar type dressing(so many places miss this when leaves are shouting out for it)!\n\nMy only gripe is with the amount of grease that emerged from the wrap on trying to pick it up, so had to use the cutlery. Now it was not that significant greasy disaster as to merit leaving some evidence for Mulder and Scully, but less is surely better, especially due to location.\n\nThe £50/m may put some off especially since central gyms charge less than half of this, but I did see some signage within that did prompt at £25/m which for me would be better for my wallet.\n\nUpper body workout(tick), 2k run(tick), 12 point MOT(to be booked), will \"I be back\"...Taking just over an hour from East Lothian in the direction of the Corn Exchange, wasn't too far out of the way, and only requires one mode of transport to get here? Also it has parking, gel in the showers incase you forgot to pack some and free wifi, just ask for the password at reception. I give it 4/5 stars for all mentioned above; possibly 5 when they add the revamped Sauna, coming soon.",

Yeah there is meat but not sure if it's truly healthy? It did fill the tum with Lemon Chooks, rice, spring rolls, and as the temperatures rise outside a strange but welcomed addition to the dessert menu multi-coloured jelly and whippy ice cream!\n\nPretty relaxed atmosphere when we arrived around 9pm, and there were only a handful of people but not more than 20. Self service meant no queues, but seating arrangements meant facing a blank wall that was crying out for a picture, yeah they have a few television monitors dotted around but who goes out to watch tv??? \n\nWith unlimited food it's so easy to overdo the quantities and some of my party did just that with three main courses, but that means hefty gym workouts to balance the status quo me thinks!\n\nIv'e been avoiding  large food chains for as long as possible, focussing on what other and sometimes alternative foodie heavens can be found in the city, but every now and then others pull you back into reality by going for the easy option; not too far, near transport links. But afterall its better to have tried a place you don't really think you'll like, than to have never tried it at all. \n\nService was chilled and cleanliness fine, any dirty dishes were quickly swept away by eagle-eyed staff, food not too bad tasting, ok for costs(evening £13). So for quick ready meals but no real idea what calories or amounts of Gluten your consuming best done rarely than often, but that's up to you!?",

I got used to it after a while but maybe I'd gone too far in my quest for differing teas this week. I really do think it needs acquired tastebuds so for me I was not ready for this yet...another time perhaps not now but sometime.\n\nChoco Brownies were just the kind of sugar rush I needed so ordered to share one of them...mmm.

An interesting place for first time check-in and not a bad choice made by others in our party. Friends had raved about it and with thirty odd reviews in Yelp thought I might try and give it a go. \n\nFirstly it's a small Italian styled place so has that European vibe to it, they have city pictures on the walls, private booths to sit and quick service. The menu is quite extensive, granted you can get all day breakfast as well as typical nosh, and for some items you can make combos up as the menu states. We chose omelettes one with smoked salmon and cream cheese, the other with chicken. \n\nFood comes with fries and salad - though I wasn't impressed with either. The fries on a cold plate are not too pleasant to eat! Would it not be more beneficial to keep the plate heated right up until serving and include any green leaves as a separate side dish? That said the plate sizes were huge, I mean larger than conventional sized dinner plates(8-12\").\n\nI might go back again to try some other dishes to see if this was just a one off but will ask for fries and salad served separately or dropped. The friendliness of staff is ok,  and it's not too busy even around 8-9pm, means you can get a seat, also the omelettes were very tasty.\n\nFavorit is also not very far away from the centre of town to walk to and competitive prices. £20-ish for two mains, one Belgian waffle dessert, two coffees, and soft drinks. I would recommend for people on a budget especially during high season or festival times.",

It also doubles as an event venue, and has private meeting room upstairs, in this structure that dominates the city skyline...but for me I have yet to fully experience a show or some food here.\n\nFor me the its location is fairly central in an converted church, now a regional meeting place where its quiet enough to escape the hussle and bussle of outside, during busy tourist season!  Enjoy the shop, free maps and guides, chatting to Hub staff finding out if there are any tickets left for usual sold out events that Edinburgh is famous for, and the afternoon weekend teas are great as well as weddings and pre-tattoo suppers.\n\nThey have wifi, not sure if it is free but according to the ticket staff, you cant get access to www from the shop area but possibly need a password from the restaurant staff. \n\nFor full information visit the hub website www.thehub-edinburgh.com",

So I'm not really sure if one store and a few others nearby selling apple products constitutes as their orchard but we'll see. They are opening to conjunction of new arrivals Air2 and Ipad Mini3 so it is sure to possibly be a very busy day?\n\nWhat you get is a very plush expensive brightly lit big window type store, and that's just from the outside, it's situated on the East end of a long shopping mile, right below and opposite a few famous hotels. A bank of desks about on the ground floor, has a multitude of products to droll over, possibly upstairs is where genius gurus will help you if needs be?\n\nPeople are sure to travel far and wide to the cities newest arrival possibly on par with when Harvey Nicks announced they would be coming to town. The \nadded bonus of the first 1000 customers will receive a free shirt in celebration of this opening.

It gave me a big happy Friday feeling to wonder through the meadows but on a Saturday. This being a prelude to festival time in the capital, in which majastically the whole city transforms into a totally different, yet intriguing place?\n\nWhat did you see? I hear you ask, well I'll tell you but it would be much better if you had experienced it for yourself? Oh ok then; a snippet if you like. An ensemble of sports, celebrities, fun-fairs, dogs, music singing, rain, singing in the rain, buskers, or if your a foodie (not beans out of a can) then things for all to do. \n\nSometimes out of respect for the people of Edinburgh the sun does come out, as it did at the weekend! Mostly its a freebie, hosted by the wonderful folks in the local community, volunteers, and a few others; that make the Meadows Festival so much better...I know! \n\nIf you look on a map for the location, it's in a big tree lined grassy field based South of city centre. Unfortunately there are no outlets for games consoles, so please leave them at home and be prepared to participate and enjoy some non electrical activity such as football, rugby, golf, cricket, jogging, skating to name a few sports that occur here.\n\nNot a lot of people know that while walking the surface of the meadows, it is really a site of burials from the time of the black death. If you spot some green mounds then these are the burial sites of plague victims. The Burgh Muir as it was previously known was a mass of Oak trees, and from 15th to 17th centuries was used to isolate carriers of the epidemic. But its alright - it was a long time ago, and I don't think they'll hear you...or will they? \n\nGenerally you get a whiff of a BBQ, if your on foot or cycling and on sunny days mostly the whitey/blue people of the city sit out and bake till their skin turns a very red Lobster colour before going a nice shade of Mahogany.  But above all the bench mark is that the Meadows Festival is nearly 40 years strong...it's that popular. So from filthiest city in Europe in 18th century to friendliest in the 21st...oh how times change as place!",

The brief odour of alcohol, lights on leather seats that catch your eye, people constantly moving about providing distraction from the film you had paid around £10 for. Not the best.

Tasty broth, pretty looking using real tomatoes for their soup and an assorment of chunky veggies, coupled with large slices of malty wholemeal type bread. I realised I'd achieved nirvana towards enjoying a fat free low calorie starter; alas, it didn't last...Feeling fresh like I'd just driven an ocean road on a sunny day in a fast car, positive by now and half full, thanks Henderson's, I moved onto another dish in my lunch quest.\n\nActII: Deathly Chocolate. I had not consumed much sweet stuff in the last week, so my weakness was to follow tummy over head by ordering a smooth sweet and yet delightful yummy chocolate coffee cup cake with last of the summer fruits on-top. Wow, intense sinning levels - this was actually served in a cup topped with calorie bust'n dollop of fresh cream. This got me thinking had I gone too far, and overloaded calories a result of my sweet tooth taking over? \n\nFinale: Care In the Community. Very thankfully but refreshingly before buttons started a' popping the grand finale, a helpful wash down of coffee, ooh nectar in a china container. Service was excellent as usual and it seemed I'd missed lunch rush. The veggie options were great, prices not bad, but strangely there were plenty tables remaining? It wasn't too long before an answer presented itself, like a crime drama unfolding...look for the evidence. Is there really an excuse for leaving dishes on most tables for more than half an hour when it's not busy?\n\nEncore: Furry dice they are not. I tried hard not to squish a tomato underfoot when sitting down, failed to catch the fruit-flys buzzing my table, or get comfy on the flat cushions(why bother) but as it was a quick in and out I didn't really mind, as these things happen during a busy day. Did I mention the kittens also left...sorry I lied; there were no kittens. But maybe if there were, then customers would be so busy playing with them they would not notice the dishes...I'm just saying!\n\nI didn't wait around for the standing ovation as was heading for cinema but relished in the fact that it was 5/5 for food options but all else 3/5, with the hope of secretly upping the star value next visit. Kittens would have been cute though if impractable?",

Being around 5.30pm, so near to closing time had to make this initial visit brief, but its seems so much brighter and airier on the inside than the alternative chains just around the block.\n\nIts cosy, has a few seats dotted around the walls and is just wide enough to fit a couple of tables. Additional high stools placed under marble worktops, great for positioning a laptop/tablet. Decked with creamy walls, Walnut countertop and black worktops abd industrial styled lighting you'd possibly think this was an extension to the office kitchen? Maybe it is, for the city workers located above in the office block cornering Princes Street.\n\nCastello's feel seems takeaway but essentially it serves brekkie through to late lunch. That includes tea, coffee panini, soup and a selection of cakes, (gf?), they may do other seasonal foods or salads, however didn't see anyone else eat these. Since they had run out of Sweet potato chilli soup, my second choice was to try Soy Cappuccino and what cake remained of the day, Seeded Banana, which was  moist, not to heavy, just right for time of day.\n\nRun by a couple of guys, and to my surprise have occupied the premises for 13 months, means upon stepping through the cafe door you feel a distinct chilled vibe to the place. Maybe it was down to the nice music they were playing like you might find on Triple JJJ radio, or the movie Garden State you know the type - surf styled music lots of guitars and drums, real instruments. \n\nCastello to sit in, well unless you had great company to chat to, or a laptop, it may need some focal point, newspapers or periodicals to make you want to stay longer, rather than just an open door. I could make a suggestion - someone who used to have a taxi firm in Haddington kept a Piranha with a £10 at the bottom of the tank, with a sign stating \"its yours if your brave enough.\"\n\nBest thing is...they make dam fine coffee!",

Not sure what type of tea they use but will find out next time I'm in.\n\nNew staff means new faces I have to remember, but all in all a fine nights chat with friends.",

I thought the bar has a cosy pre-theatre venue feel to it. Good start if your going to the nearby Playhouse or Festival Theatre each less than 10 minutes walk.\n\nFrom velvet curtains, large armchairs and prints of Ye' old town adorning the walls the sparklers in your cocktail completes the mood. Ambient lighting in the right places with corners to snuggle into, mixed background music playing instrumental doh-whop jazz, or Scottish sounds in abundance will make any visitor to Edina feel welcome.\n\nI heard the bar food is to try, but with half hour left for serving, maybe next time. If you find yourself sitting at the back or to the left of bar, then look out the windows. You will get a grand view of the touristy Walter Scott Monument, or to some, the large spiky thing on Princes Street East. This is also the area where you also might glimpse a real live Scotsman playing his pipes, sticking out of a bag; that some say the noise created is used to attract and capture haggis in the highlands?\n\nGreat chat with bar staff, who are friendly and know their stuff around the alcoholic chemicals. Since Waverley didn't have any Innes&Gunn I almost tried another dark bottled beer name Edinburgh Ale, but what was off putting was the price for half a pint.

Bring blankets and food and you are set! \n\nIf you sign up to be a Designated Driver at the beginning of the game, you get a free drink, which is really nice on a super hot day. \n\nI personally think night games are the most fun, but day games are a lot of fun too!

Some of the best service I have ever received! \n\nAs far as food goes, it was just as good! We had chips and salsa which were great. I had the taco salad and I really liked it! It was large and really filling, more like a bowl than a salad. It came with beef and beans, cheese, lettuce, sour cream and guacamole, in a tortilla bowl! I got it with the green chili sauce and it was very flavorful and the perfect amount of spice! \n\nMy brother got the beef and guacamole tacos, and he thought they were great! He loved the guacamole and the tacos were super filling and had great flavor. \n\nMy dad got the burrito enchilada style with the green chili sauce and he said it was delicious! \n\nOverall this is a great Mexican place in Surprise!

The manager apologized and asked me If I would like to come back to the restaurant or if he could have my address so he could send me a gift certificate. I decided to go back to the restaurant, when I got the restaurant I told the person at the counter my name and they already had a bag set aside for me, the manager came over and explained to me there was another full salad in the bag, and he put additional dressing for the salad we already had, and additionally he gave me a coupon for free lettuce wraps.(which mental note: I need to use)\n\nI must say I was impressed with this manager, and it was refreshing after being in situations where a manager has taken back the bag/plate and essentially \"un-F$@k's\" your food and returns it to you.\n\nOverall great customer service, consistent food, and a good option for takeout in surprise.",

Kokopelli has been one of these consistent wines, we tend to lean towards sweet whites and find they offer some derivation of almost all or our favorite varietals (reisling, muscat, sauvignon etc) The food has always been consistently good and we were thrilled when we heard we were getting a Kokopelli in surprise, after visiting the surprise location, we were pleased to find that the same consistency and quality carries over from the chandler location, at my last visit I ordered the fish and chips, which were severals strips of tilapia wiht crunchy tasty panko breading. the atmosphere is casual especially with the sun city crowd, they usually have live music a few nights a week.\n\nWe'll definitely be visiting this place more often now that they're in our neighborhood",

        "text": "Despite Christine S and her stellar review, I'd have to say \"Surprise you can do better\" I've eaten country kitchen 3 times at time of this review, the food is nothing denny's IHOP or village inn don't offer, I'm a bit of a sucker for fish fry's so the one time we actually dined in, I had the fish fry and it's not bad, but nothing special. we've gotten their breakfast to go on a lazy weekend morning, the pancakes are decent, however my breakfast seemed to be kind of sparse on meat, \n\nthe other night we got back from happy hour and appetizers with some coworkers of mine and we were still hungry, not feeling like fast food we call up country kitchen and order an order of their sliders and 2 milkshakes. they don't give us an eta or a total on the phone.\n\nso I wait about 10-15 minutes, leave my house which is about 2 mi away, arrive at the restaurant to find it completely barren at about 7:30PM, I approach the counter and the manager just continues to mess with his blackberry never looking up eventually, a hostess comes from the back and greets me, mind you it's already been 15 minutes and all they need to do was grill some small beef pattys and drop some fries, I still end up waiting another 10 minutes for my food, only to have everyone disappear into the back of the restaurant again to have another server come out confused and try to seat me. eventually I get the food, the sliders aren't bad, but there's only 3, WTF it's an unwritten rule that sliders come in even numbers, I don't know if it's just me, or working in a White Castle as a teen, but 3 sliders could potentially cause a rift in some relationships, \n\nthe decor is an orgy of applebees, IHOP and denny's but imagine if you arrived  at the \"campy wall crap\" store only to find they'd already been cleaned out by an applebees corporate decorator, the decorations range from giant utensils, wireframe art, sports posters and scenic views.  I'm really not sure which direction they were trying to go.\n\nunfortunately Country Kitchen is the closest full service restaurant to my home so I will probably end up back here some lazy saturday morning picking up eggs and pancakes.\n\nI was excited to see Surprise Pointe being built and to see more services coming closer to me, so far I've only seen more of the same.",

        "text": "We came in on a Saturday night, someone from our party had made a reservation for a large party, the host stand didn't know what we were talking about, and had to go ask the other staff, it turns out whoever took the reservation didn't think passing that along to the host was necessary.\n\nThough, I'm not sure why they even inquired on the reservation when there were probably 3 customers in the whole restaurant.  multiple school buses of senior citizens could have showed up and they'd still have ample seating.\n\ndespite this they moved some tables around and promptly seated us\n\nI can say their beer selection is not bad, they have a reasonably wide selection from a number of different breweries, we got our drinks, and luckily this was a talkative bunch because otherwise the next 2 hours would have been a lot more awkward.\n\nlooking over the menu there's a wide assortment of dishes. I opted for the beer battered cod with rustic fries and homemade slaw.\n\nOur server on multiple occasions told us our entrees were coming right up, but this seemed to drag out for at least an hour. eventually 5 out of our party of 8 got their entrees coincidentally they had all ordered the keg burger, my wife reported her burger as being somewhat bland. and just from appearance the fries didn't look very \"Rustic\" unless rustic means not very crisp and look like they'd been sitting too long\n\nActually I just looked up Rustic,if that was the intent I'm never ordering anything Rustic ever again.\n\n(Rustic : constructed or made in a plain and simple fashion, in particular.)\n\nSo a few minutes later our server explains that one of the Kitchen staff walked out, so we're still waiting on the other 3 entrees,  as other reviewers have mentioned, nothing was offered in consolation, not a comped drink, not a dessert, and no bread, seriously is it that hard to keep bread on hand.\n\nSo probably another 30 minutes goes by, I finally get my food,\nI would call it \"Not Bad\" the beer batter isn't bad the portion was 3 good sized pieces, the fish was cooked well enough, the fries we're \"Rustic\", but I hadn't eaten lunch so I ate them, the slaw was actually pretty good.  but the beer battered fish isn't something I can't get 10 other places with better service and prices. definitely wasn't worth $12\n\nprobably another 5-10 minutes goes by and the last 2 people in our party that had ordered the skewers finally get their food. NOTE: at this point there were still probably 3 tables in the entire restaurant, not exactly what I\"d call a dinner rush.\n\nAfter a while the manager comes over and apologizes claims it's not his day, explains again that a chef had quit,  supposedly he gave the 2 people that had ordered skewers 2 dollars off their meals, because apparently he thought that was sufficient to repair the damage.\n\nTo The Owners:\nthese bad service experiences seem to be spreading fast, I understand it's a new restaurant and you may be finding your feet, but if you want your doors to be open a few months down the road, you need to understand the value of customer service, it's ok to make mistakes, but if you make a mistake and your customer pays for it they won't be your customer, if you make a mistake it's on you to repair that relationship, either in the form of taking charge and making up for poor service, or COMPING the hell out of your diners bills, you could have COMPED every drink and still made $150 off our table just on food.\n\nInstead you took us for about $200 and knocked off a whopping $4 from the diners who waited 90 minutes for their food.\n\nthe part you don't see is you'll never get a dollar out of those 8 wallets again, and you could have if you made it right which you didn't, IT TOTALLY SUCKS that your chef quit, but that's not your customer's problem and your customers are free to go somewhere else if you don't acknowledge that.\n\nHope you get your shit together.",

For one they know how to cut my hair better than I do.  They seem to record and keep their customer hairstyle preference in their computer, so most times I can just sit down sit back and 20-30 minutes later be looking much better than when I walked in.  The stylist are young and most of them are friendly and talkative but don't push the matter if you're not feeling particularly chatty that day. also 13.00 feels like a steal, I know how much my wife and some women pay for their hair and to me it seems ridiculous, but I guess it's a matter of priorities.  addtionally it's located not 50 feet from the front door to my neighborhood safeway, so it's almost relieving sometimes to arrive and find they have a 20 minute wait which gives me just enough time to walk next door and pickup some odds and ends.\n\nI know it's not exactly a world class salon, but for a guy like me, it serves me exactly the way I need it. so 5 stars from this reviewer.",

You walk in there appear to be servers, with a seat yourself vibe because there is no sign that says otherwise.\n\nWe sit down and a few min later one of the \"servers\" comes over and tells us that we order at the counter and they bring us the food, ok, change \"servers\" to \"runners\" no big deal moving on. I noticed once we were seated another family came in and same episode repeated, nothing wrong with the counter approach, just some signage would be good.\n\nI'd been craving a pastrami burger and one of the reason I came was to try their pastrami burger. I order the pastrami burger, the wife orders a pastami sandwich and we split an order of chili cheese fries. I ask for them to add Swiss to her pastrami sandwich, \"we don't have swiss\" only american, ok no cheese. apparently the only cheese they have is american, later I started going over the menu contemplating how many items would be better with Swiss.\n\nwe get the food at the table and it looks good, the runner was friendly and asked if we needed anything else.\n\nMy burger is well cooked, looks good and fresh, the taste is mediocre, nothing wrong, but nothing standing out the pastrami seems bland in comparison to some others, a bit too salty as well.\n\nThe fries were crispy which is a big plus, the chili was pretty good as well\n\nMy didn't even eat half of her sandwich I could tell these some thing off-putting about it.\n\nAll in all a good meal, but not for foodies, perfectly prepared fresh, pedestrian food in my opinion.  still I want to like this place because it has a lot of potential, maybe if I come back you'll wow me with the \"eggs\"\n\nand please get the swiss situation under control it's delicious.",

        "text": "Stir Fry Paradise reminds me of when I used to live in Mesa and my roommate and I would go to Y.C.'s and gorge ourselves on noodles and meat.  I was never the packing champ but he was, one time he got a full large bowl and a small bowl in one trip through the line and still had two take home cartons after eating a mountain of noodles.  I hear they've amended the rules in recent years, but I digress.\n\nStir Fry Paradise does an excellent job on delivering exactly what their name states, all you can eat Mongolian style BBQ,  build your own stir fry at a very reasonable price.  Previous posters mention just how clean this establishment is, you walk in and look around and you can tell just how much care they put into keeping their restaurant in the most cleanly and sanitary condition possible.  The Stir Fry bar is setup very well with all the vegetables and ingredients you would expect. All of the ingredients seemed fresh and in good condition. The staff also did a good job of not cross contaminating my bowl with someone elses, I've been to places like this before where once your stir fry hits the grill, it gets passed around like a lady of the night and you usually don't get back quite what you handed them.  I opted for a Lo Mein style stir fry with beef, chicken, mushrooms, water chestnuts, carrots, bean sprouts and cabbage.  I do wish these places would post a handful of sauce recipes on a board, I've been notoriously bad at over or under seasoning my noodles in the past.  However this time around my instincts must have been right, I made a hoisin based sauce with their house sauce and lots of garlic sauce that turned out pretty tasty and didn't need a drop of soy sauce.  I did think their sauces were more flavorful than some Mongolian BBQ style places I've been, and once cooked they had a better consistency then I've had before.  I ended up with a mountain of noodles that I thought I couldn't finish but somehow did.  Additionally they also have a pre-prepared buffet style section with items like crab puffs, egg rolls, wanton, I believe Sweet and Sour pork, possibly sesame chicken, these fried sugar coated donuts, and of course what no restaurant of this caliber would be without \"Jello\". which I actually did partake in a little bit of. Other than a single egg roll I didn't really try the buffet area much but that's only because I was more than satisfied with my stir fry which is what I came for anyways.\n\nI really enjoyed stir fry paradise and hope to come back often.  maybe next time my eyes won't be bigger than my bowl and I'll actually try the buffet items.",

We arrived to find a well decorated mexican restaurant, we started looking over the menu and after a few minutes we started to think the joke was that nothing on the menu costs less than 8.99 except salads.  luckily my wife was able to find a tostada for 8.50, I ordered the fountain sampler which was their appetizer sampler platter.  We got our food shortly after.  Both plates were huge, I had a mountain of nachos, several quesadillas, taquitos, and mini-chimichanga's.  the nachos were very cheesy and tasty and I really enjoyed the mini-chimi's.  I probably only ate half the plate and had plenty of leftovers.  Overall the food was very good.  the coupon was a bit offsetting though when the average menu price was 14.99.  I'd like to come back when we're less broke and order some of the more specialized entrees.",

        "text": "Ended up here last week looking for a quick place to have lunch with a friend.  we thought they weren't open but someone came out and waved us in.  trying to catch a movie in an hour we decided to try them out.  we were first disappointed to find out that they don't have chicago style thin crust.  \"They have flatbread\"  but this was remiss.\n\nlet me preface by stating I spent the first 18 years of my life growing up in Northern Illinois and I'd like to think I know a thing or two about chicago pizza, generally you have your more popular Chicago style deep with the stuffed topping and a layer of sauce on top, then the lesser known \"but still delicious\" Chicago style thin, which is thicker than NY style usually square cut with lots of cheese and some of the toppings under the cheese, usually with sweeter sauce.\n\nwell Uno doesn't have this, they have flatbread, but I'm sorry I thought I was going into an \"AUTHENTIC CHICAGO STYLE PIZZA\" place for a chicago style pizza.  After we gave up the dream of thin crust we ordered a deep dish with a few meats. a while later (remember it's deep dish) we got our pizza and although it wasn't bad it wasn't anything special and I think they should maybe tone it down on the \"CHICAGO THIS, and CHICAGO that, keep your windy city to yourself, cuz I'm not fooled\"\n\nI give them credit for getting the pizza out in a reasonable time frame, but paying $25 for a pizza that was \"alright\" didn't leave me in a good mood.  But you can be kind of a dick about pizza when you grew up eating what you believe is some of the best pizza in the world.",

Feeling like something different I start cruising around surprise looking to see if anything new sprang up.  \n\nI remembered seeing the sign for Mei Wei and wondered if they thought maybe they would get more business by varying their namesake by one letter to the popular chain.  Nonetheless I decided to stop in.\n\nI walked in and the the restaurant had a dark mood lit feel, but was actually well decorated.  It also appeared very clean.   I was immediately greeted and the staff was very cordial,  I started looking over a menu to get take out and was offered a recommendation.  \n\nI should have been weary when they offered the Orange Peel Chicken.  but I gave it a chance because they used the word peel and just orange chicken, got an order of egg rolls too just to try.   10 minutes later my food was ready and I was on my way.  I got home and was pleasantly surprised by the portion size and including the egg rolls probably could have fed 2 people.  The food itself unfortunately was mediocre, the usual white rice and crispy meat faire, which isn't bad but for 12.50 I was expecting a bit more.\n\nFood was ok but lacked any sort of flare or appeal, almost wonder if this would be a better lunch destination.  It's official Surprise is culturally bankrupt when it comes to Chinese/Asian food.  I might try it again, but don't hold your breath.\n\nBetter wipe the lipstick off my collar before Pei Wei finds out.",

Since my wife isn't a huge fan of seafood we tend to go to all the places my wife doesn't like when we catch up.  My friend suggested sullivans pier, we used to go there years ago for fish and chips.  The restaurant seems to have moved or opened a new location on Southern Ave.  Nothing much for decor, seems to be a former burger king.  We were both drawn in by the coconut platter.  1 side, 2 HUGE coconut shrimp, and 2 big pieces of coconut whitefish for around $8. we also shared some friend mushrooms.  The shrimp were fairly fresh and tasty, the tropical sauce they server with the paltter is very good.  the fish were crispy and satisfying, and I tend to be a bit of a purist with fish and chips usually just Malt vinegar, and a lemon wedge, occasionally tartar sauce. The last time we had seafood together we went to Red Lobster and were underwhelmed with about the same amount of food except it cost around $60 for two.\n\nI only wish I had something like this on the westside of town.",

I'm a fan of the snickerlicious or just the traditional mocha iced or hot, though lately I've got onboard the iced coffee train. everything I've had has been good quality, another interesting touch is coffee ice, if you order an iced drink they actually use frozen coffee cubes as the ice, so even when the ice melts it doesn't spoil your drink.\n\nthey have a drive through and they're usually pretty quick,one of my friends that used to loaf around mesa with me always insists on going here when he's on my side of town. prices are reasonable, and they don't feel the need to blend italian and french nonsensical words as drink names just for the heck of it.\n\n good place to stop for coffee if you're in the area.",

Let me start with the decor, this place is a blend somwhere between a nightclub with large glass doors and ambient light, and a Central Mexico villa, complete with faux sky fresco on the ceiling of the central dining room, all centered around an odd statue of a man in a poncho and a child in dining room.  Confused decor aside let's talk about the food.\n\nthe Nacho's I had we're actually very good, they appeared to be hard taco sized tortilla's broken in half with a bit of melted cheese taco meat, lettuce and sour cream on them.  My Wife told me about this greenish hot sauce the waiter put on the table that he said was really hot, and no one else at the table was daring enough to try.  Generally liking spicy food, I gave it a shot, it had a little kick, but nothing like some hot sauces I've tasted, nontheless I doused my nachos with it.\n\nFor dinner I ordered the Alambre De Camarones, which was essentially 6 large shrimp wrapped in bacon, stuffed with peppers, served with a queso sauce for dipping.  The dish was also served with rice and broccoli (which I found odd)\n\nThe shrimp was very good, dipping bacon wrapped shrimp in cheese may sound a bit decadent, but you might want to try it.  The rice is nothing you can't get anywhere else, but still not bad. The thing that kept this from being a four star review was the choice of Broccoli as a side. I know broccoli isn't unheard of in mexican cooking, I recognize the difference between Tex-Mex and what would be called Mexico City food.\nMaybe I'm just being a picky little kid that doesn't want to eat his vegetables (which I did, the cheese helps). It just seemed like an odd pairing to me.\n\nMy wife had a an enchilada combo plate with beef and chicken which she let me taste and it was really good, any both her and my Father in Law's meals were served with these tasty papas with cheese and poblano peppers in them.  Which I secretly wish I had instead of the broccoli.\n\nAll in all the meal was pretty filling, tasty and our server was attentive, so I can't really complain. and would return to Abuelos",

The first says in big bold letters, that the AZ Republic mistakenly wrote that they had 5 critical health code violations, but if you look at the report you will see that there are none.  The other document is the actual health board report.  My wife and I arrived before the rest of our party and we're seated promptly.   The decor is kind of mixed, some tuscan style murals on the wall, with a fake rooftop/awning that surrounds the restaurant I suppose to create the feeling of being in some kind of tuscan courtyard,  lots of track lighting dimmed to create an ambience to mask the fact that the building was designed to be a warehouse.  Overall they actually do a pretty good job of creating an atmosphere.  The service was a bit slow, but my beverage service never seemed to suffer, which makes me suspect the issues were more in the kitchen than the wait staff.  I ordered a double-thick stuffed pork loin chop from their specials menu which was described as a thick tender pork loin stuff with fontina cheese served with a mushroom, proscuttio and sausage demi-glace.  It seemed like we waited a long time for our order however it included soup which was nice, I had a cup of clam chowder, nothing special but not bad.  They also kept bring us more bread which I find a lot of restaurants are almost hesitant to give more than 1 or 2 bread services, the bread was served with a cup of hummus which wasn't terrible, but kind of watery and at this point sorry but FEZ has ruined me for all other hummus's.  The food finally came and this is where they made up their fourth star, the pork loin was very good and perfectly cooked I really enjoyed the demi-glace and it was served with I believe a squash and some kind of potato side which was very good.  for dessert I ended up ordering a slice of cheesecake hopefully to share, none of the adults at the table wanted to share with me and I was feeling very full, luckily my year and a half old niece was with us and although her vocal skills are limited she displayed her approval by thrusting the spoon in my general direction each time I gave her a bite.\n\nOverall a good dining experience, Did I mention that Mike greeted us and checked on our table twice through our meal.  I always like restaurants where ownerscirculate to make themselves known but don't lurk.  The food was a bit slow coming, however I failed to mention my Father-in-Law ordered a braised osso bucco lamb shank which may have increased preperation time.  I would definitely go back to Mike's but would like my meal to take less than 2 hours.",

After a quick walkthrough of this theatre you will quickly realize that the entire facility is state of the art.  The movie posters are actual LCD's that move and change, the bathroom has a hand dryer that's revolutionary. Even the vending machine that I paid a 500% markup for a bottle of water had a robotic arm scan and pick my beverage.\n(when did we decide that  twist... thud!!! wasn't good enough)\n\nAll the movies are presented in what I think they call Pure Digital, which I don't know what it is, but it looks and sounds phenomenal.  An Usher comes in to every theatre before the movie and introduces the movie which gives it a very personal touch.  And they have these new seats that they can't stop talking about and would try them if not for the fact that the ad they use shows a wave moving across the ass of the seat.\n\nI can't speak for the food because I don't go to the movie theatre to eat, If I wanted to pay 5 times the price for seven eleven food I'd (actually I don't know where I'd go, that's just kind of a shitty practice in the industry)\n\noverall the seats are comfortable, the presentation quality is good, the movies tend to start on time with most of the previews shown before start time (genious).

Luckily last night I was finally able to see what Mazie's was all about. \n\nWe ended up meeting up with fellow Yelpers Melissa H and Chris H, it was a beautiful night so it was very fitting that we sat outside.  our waiter was very prompt and kept up with our table very well, It wasn't a slow night by any means but the usual hustle and bustle was absent and everything just slowed down for a few hours.  We all had a glass of wine and shared the spinach artichoke dip, the flavor was subtle and not overpoweringly salty like some dishes I've had, the consistency was good too.  We all Ordered off the sandwich/lunch menu, I Ordered the pizza burger and was not disappointed, the burger was thick and hearty, stuffed with pepperoni sausage and cheese, topped with a rich marinara.  We ended up staying about 3 hours just talking and catching up and even after we'd paid the bill they still checked up on us several times to see if we needed anything and made it clear that we could stay as long as we wanted.\n\nAll in all a good night.",

I was somewhat reluctant to go back to cheuvront so soon when some of our friends asked us to go with them after the OYE at the Heard Museum. regardless we went for appetizers and cocktails, with a party of at least 10 we were able to get in and out in about an hour and a half. My Wife and I shared some of the pork empanada's which were actually very good, and I had a Pizza Blanc with scallops and shrimp, and for the first seafood pizza I've ever had I was quite impressed.",

        "text": "Well I finally made it down to caswell's last saturday to use my new membership my father in law got me. I didn't have a reservation but they were still able to accomodate both of us by giving us both our own shooting lane.  The Staff seems really personable like they know their customers and their needs.\n\nI ended up renting a HK (Heckler & Koch) USP Compact 9MM, I put 150 rds though it with no malfunctions, great gun unfortunately I don't have $800.00 to spend on a handgun.  Nonetheless had a great time, got to shoot my Father in Law's GSG5 .22 MP5 clone too.  The range itself is nicer, they actually have keypads where you enter in the desired range for your target.  Also the rangemaster was watchful but unintrusive to those that we're handling their guns safely.  My only minor complaint was that it being an air conditioned range they had the A/C on and it was a cold day to begin with so it was very cold and found myself wearing my jacket most of the time, which is no big deal.  But with rentals you only get 1 magazine, so it's not fun to begin with to force 13 hard little pieces of brass into a magazine every time you run empty, let alone when you're hands are aching from the cold.  Rather than complaining I decided to be a man about it and said it could be worse.  overall it was still a great range visit.\n\nAfter shooting I was looking around the store and handled a few handguns, a few sigs, a Springfield XD9, and a Walther P99, I asked about an inexpensive but reliable 9mm.  And was pointed to the CZ (Ceska zbrojovka) line of handguns.  Apparently it's a Czech company but it's really popular with competition shooters and are known for being some of the most reliable and accurate guns out there and has actually been considered as a standard  government issue sidearm, unfortunately due to political reasons (favoritism towards germany) it was not chosen.\nafter holding and feeling out the CZ-75B I was sold, and being a new member I got great discount too. Can't wait to clean it out and put some rounds through it.\n\nHoping to go back soon to put some more rounds downrange and maybe pickup some accessories.  Also planning on taking CCW here at some point.\n\nMaybe one day I'll review a restaurant again.",

Overall our service experience has been good, the waitresses seem to remember us when we come back,  if you're not looking to spend $$$ some very high quality burgers can be had for around $10.

I'd heard good things from family members, and last week the opportunity finally presented itself.  The first thing I noticed is that their lobby is virtually non existent, tons of people huddled around the hostess podium with a wait upwards of 30 minutes.  To be fair it's about 6:30PM on a friday and they have a bar, but the bar is completely full as well. many patrons were waiting around the edge of the glass enclosed kitchen in the middle of the restaurant which I found odd.\n\nWhen we finally got seated our waiter greated us promptly with what seemed like a very \"forced\" brooklyn accent, \" Ya Evah Been Heeyah Befo,... It's Good Pie\" pleasantries aside he was very prompt and took good care of the table.  He even gave my neice who was with us some pizza dough to keep her occupied.\n\nI ordered an individual red sauce pizza with with pepperoni, sausage and mushroom.  They have 3 different sauces, red, white and pesto.\n\nThe pizza came and was actually very good, the mozzarella was the fresh kind, not too much cheese, the sauce was a thick puree without being chunky. the toppings were very fresh, everything in sliced form, even the sausage. definitely need a fork and knife to eat this. supposedly it was a 12\" pizza, but being new york style it was very thin, and I was actually kind of surprised I finished the whole thing.\n\nAll in all not a bad restaurant, not a bad pizza and I would go back.",

We arrived to find they have a variety of greek, mediterranean, italian dishes, as well as traditional american including many diner staples and deli sandwiches on their menu.  from appearances there's not a lot to look at, the space is pretty barren other than a central counter and a condiment station in the corner, however the space appeared to be very clean. Our server was very attentive and polite despite being the only server, and refilled our drinks regularly.  After recently trying the also newly opened Greek Corner I was anxious to have a Gyro face-off.  I ordered the Gyro dinner which includes choice of  salad, soup or coleslaw as well as bread service.  I ordered the soup which was a chicken, rice and lemon juice soup, it was actually very enjoyable and well made.  The bread was a crisp bread served with a plate of garlic cloves in olive oil which again was not bad.  My dinner arrived with a large portion of Gyro meat, Feta and tzatziki.  Which brings me to the only thing that mildly bothered me.  \n\nAs with most greek dishes they are served with a mountainous portion of rice pilaf, this was no different however they seem to put a red I can only guess sweet marinara / tomato sauce on the rice, and not just a drizzle in the middle, my rice was pretty much drenched in what tasted like marinara.  I've had greek food hundreds of times in my life and I never recall anytime having marinara on the pilaf.  it might actually be pretty good to some, but I'm also the type when I eat spaghetti I only put a minimal amount of sauce on my spaghetti so this may just be a matter of preference.\n\nthe only reason I subtract points is because this was not stated on the menu.  Other than that the Gyro meat was generously served, thick and very tasty.  I would order the dish again but would ask they omit the sauce next time.\n\nAdditonally their breakfast menu looks very tempting, Melissa was pining over an old man's omelette at the table across from us most of the time we were there and we both plan to come back for breakfast.\n\nDid I mention the prices. the two of us had 2 entrees including bread, soup and drinks for just over $20 the same Gyro dinner would have cost $15 at some other restaurants.  almost no dinners are more than $10, breakfast items average $5-$7 the same with lunch items.\n\nI'm anxious to try breakfast at Nick's as well as some of their more traditional faire, and hope to add Nick's into our rotation.",

So when some friends that just got back into town asked us to meet them for dinner here we didn't think we were in for any surprises. As usual our server was prompt and attentive, unfortunately when the food came I can't say the same.  Two out of the Four of our party had ordered calzones, we got our food and started eating.  The other calzone had the wrong ingredients and had to be remade, but by the time the remake made it out to us it was cold.  Mine was missing an ingredient and also contained uncooked mushrooms, which if you eat mushrooms you understand the world of difference in texture and flavor from cooked to uncooked.  In the end our server and the manager apologized multiple times for the food and explained they have a new chef.  She also comped one of the calzones and comped a dessert too which will make me come back.\n\nI like Babbo and know what they can do, I just might stick to the surprise location for a short time after this.\n\nKudos to the manager and our server for at least being consistent.",

Whereas most of the indoor pistol ranges cost 15.00 just for an hour.\n\nThey provide, benches stools, benchrests, sandbags, most of what you need, minus the actual firearms and ammo.  We stayed around 3 hours and shot a variety of different guns of different calibers going all the way from .22LR up to .303 british, at ranges going all the way from 25 yards out to 100+ yards.  the rangemasters were aware but not breathing down our necks, they corrected shooters making safety mistakes, however more or less left us alone aside from the occasional glance since we both seem to be pretty safe around our guns.  it's quite a trek, but this might have to be a monthly thing.",

The average Roll Price ranges from $5 to $8  with some special rolls costing a bit more.  We split about 4 Rolls and each had a Kirin. The California Crunch rolls were tasty, the spicy Crab was a big hit with my friend, and the Crunchy Tempura Shrimp with eel sauce was my favorite.  \n\nWe also tried one of their many special rolls, we went for the \"Booty Booty Roll\" not just for the name but because it seemed to have a complex flavor profile.  based on our personal tastes, we didn't find the  Booty Booty Roll to be \n\n\"Rockin Everywhere\"\n\nbut it was good, just maybe too many flavors at once, I would probably go for something simpler next time.  I also saw some of the other food coming out of the kitchen and it looked good, and being that the thought of raw fish would disgust my wife I know she'd be able to find something to eat too.\n\nI plan to come back soon.",

The meat tends to be bland and not better than I can get at an $13.95 special steakhouse. the difference is the same smaller cut of meat costs 21.99 at black angus.  The appetizers aren't bad but nothing I haven't seen some derivation of before.  the service wasn't bad, but nothing else really stood out to me, except the high prices.\n\nif they want to treat me to a steak dinner, who am I to refuse, but you won't see me there of my own accord.",

The pizza is consistent with their Glendale Ave location. and if you've never had their pizza before I highly recommend \nit\n\nI could go on and on about growing up in Illinois and eating all the authentic Chicago pizza's. but I won't , because if there's one thing AZ is full of it's transplants bashing the local fare and raving about the food at home.\n\nkeep in mind they serve chicago style thin, which is a change of pace compared to the classic chicago style deep with the layer of sauce on top and the toppings stuffed in the middle. Typically with chicago style thin, some of the toppings will be under the cheese and it's generally a sweeter marinara than most are used to.\n\nIf you're not in the mood for pizza I can also recommend the spaghetti calzone which my wife will order from time to time, I recommend ordering this with meatballs.  but personally I'm a sucker for the pizza, also the prices are pretty reasonable and expect to have leftovers unless you've got a real A-game appetite\n\nIf you don't know the story behind Spinato's originally it was under the name Aurelio's which if you've ever been in the chicagoland area is a local family owned favorite throughout the state. and my personal favorite, and one of my \"we have to eat here\" places when I go home to visit.  Aurelios started out in AZ by a relative of the Aurelio family and eventually the family owned franchised took off the aurelios name, but continued to deliver the same high quality pizza under their own name Spinato.\nthe pizza is not verbatim to Aurelios in IL, but it's damn close, damn tasty and good enough to inspire childhood nostalgia and a drive from surprise to 16th st and Bell.\n\nI'm almost a little sad that I didn't discover Spinato's up until last year. My wife has in the past even looked into getting mail order frozen pizza from Aurelios dry ice and absorbinent fees and all. and the closest thing I could find was deno's which was made in  the same style but the flavors were different.  fortunately they like to order this pizza at work and one day I tasted some pizza and was immediately reminded, I looked at the box did some googling and was amazed that they were here all along.\n\nI hope to frequent Spinato's and hope they setup a location further west.",

I admit I arrived a little later than the rest of the party but it couldn't have been more than 5-10 minutes.  Upon arrival I found out there was only one waitress for the entire floor which was probably 4000 sq ft and 20+ tables, and it was reasonably busy.  The rest of my party had already ordered food and had drinks. Wow this awesome GM must not grasp the concept that on friday afternoon's starting around 3-4ish mass amounts of people tend to like to drown away their sorrows. I ordered a fried shrimp basket and after about 5 minutes got my beer,  then after another 20 or so minutes the rest of my party received their food.  I proceeded to wait what felt like an additional half hour or more to get my food, and most of my party was finishing up their food.  (this always bugs me being the last person to get their food, you have the feeling everyone else wants to leave, but you're still hungry)  I'm not sure of the exact time but I recall checking the time and it had been around an hour.  to their credit the shrimp was pretty good, and the beer was very cold.  The menu a shadow of it's former self looks like a Fortune 500 company after it's latest quarterly earnings meeting. all in all a bit of a disappointment, being that the original incarnation of the brookside had it's share of unresolved problems to begin with.\n\nI wouldn't say I wouldn't go back, but I don't think it's something I would suggest when asked.",

        "text": "We stopped in at the Irish Wolfhound last night on a wim for a beer, little did we know that it was their \"official\" grand opening, they've been open for a few months and we've been meaning to try them.  We walked in the door and the man on stage playing irish folksongs on his guitar actually stopped his song pointed at us and said \"DO YOU HAVE A RESERVATION\"  the indoor part of the bar was packed, so we decided to check out the outdoor patio.  the patio was busy but we were able to easily find a table, let me also mention that the chair have this plush padding on them, and also not all of the space heaters were running just a few so there wasn't that weird outdoor sweatbox effect.  A server greated us within a minute or two and took our drink orders, they had my favorite irish beer \"Smithwick's\" a few minutes later we had our beers and they took our food order.  I decided to order the Ciaran's Fish and Chip's Sandwich which included a cup of soup, I chose the Irish Coast Seafood Chowder.  \n\nNow I have this thing about soup with certain restaurants, my theory is that if a restaurant has one good soup, usually all there other soups are just as good.  The soup I had was amazing, creamy chowder with either shrimp/prawns, calamari and I believe scallops, very hearty and we were very excited to find out you can get soup to go for very reasonable prices.  My wife doesn't share the same pension for seafood that I do, so she chose the Potato Leak soup with her meal which I also tried and was just as delicious. \n\nOur meals came and my sandwich was good size with a piece of fish that took up most of the roll with coleslaw on top of the fish filet.  The sandwich was Delicious, imagine if the Filet of Fish from McDonalds had a cousin that went back to college and finished his degree, that would be this sandwich. I thoroughly enjoyed every bite of it, I'm pretty sure they batter the fish with Guiness.\n\nwe stayed a bit longer and had a few beers, our server was on top of things despite the drunken chinese fire drill that was occurring on the patio and inside.\n\nWe will definitely be back.",

The place is huge, they have just about everything, even was able to pick up an HDMI cable when I got my new bluray player and needed one in a pinch.\nIt's typically pretty clean and well stocked and staff are friendly.\n\nThe only drawback would be how busy this store can get at times.  It can be difficult to find parking without walking half a klick at times, which I don't mind, but not when I'm in a hurry.  At times I find myself going to the smaller Safeway across the street because I know I can get in and out.\n\nOtherwise not a bad grocery store to live a stones throw (probably of the rocket propelled variety) away from",

Needless to say the amount of people wearing t-shirts with windsor knotted ties was astounding, the attraction definitely seems to be in the novelty, They also had a country crooner type singer that was way too loud and got annoying quickly.  \n\nThe food was OK at best, I ordered a steak and chicken combo, with a baked potato, the chicken was a 1/4 chicken so if you're squeemish about bones, avoid this.

        "text": "anyone that knows me know's that I'm not shy around guns, and lately I've been wanting to get back into the shooting hobby.  since the economy  is hurting and we just bought a house it couldn't come at a worse time.  Fortunately full service ranges like shooters world offer affordable rentals.  I rented a Sig Sauer P226 9x19mm parabellum.  The gun performed amazingly 150 rounds downrange and only 1 malfunction which was easily cleared.  \n\nI can't quite say the same for my Wife, she wasn't sure which handgun to rent, so I suggested she rent the Sig Sauer Mosquito chambered in 22LR, which I'd been considering purchasing myself as an inexpensive target shooter.  she's not terribly versed with guns, but she's shot in the past in the desert and performed quite well despite inexperience, and did so as well tonight.  Unfortunately the Mosquito has a bit of a strong recoil spring, and with all rentals per their policy require you to use their ammunition.  unfortunately the 22LR rounds they offer don't seem to have quite enough kick to complete the cycle of ejecting the spent round and loading the next.  Almost every other round I had to assist her in clearing the weapon.  Failure to Feed, Failure to Eject, Double Feeds, Stovepipes, you name it.  Luckily one of the friendly female range officers noticed her plight tried to assist, and when I showed her what was happening and offered to exchange the rental free of charge.  After that she got a ruger mark II and had a fairly error free experience the rest of the time.\n\nThe highlight of the outing was when my Father-in-law  accidentally walked out of the shooting bay with his unloaded GSG5 rifle. and when one of the range officers noticed him and warned him.  And then when he did it again and was asked to leave the range area by the range master.to be fair he was trying to teach his wife who had never shot a round in her life how to shoot, and may have been a bit distracted.  \n\nAlthough I'm sure it was upsetting to him, after having been formally trained by law enforcement professionals in my brief law enforcement career several years ago.  He violated safety protocols and rules set forth by the facility.  I also got warned once when placing the unloaded, slide locked back P226 back into the rental bag, the bag was about 6 inches sticking out of the back of the shooting bay.  I was warned but more politely reminded than a dressing down, and they merely recommended that in the future I bring the bag to the shooting bench for safety reasons.\n\nI know beyond a doubt that I can handle a firearm safely, but I have to understand the view of the range officer in that they don't know how versed or experienced you are so it's necessary to treat everyone as a novice to ensure a safe and fun shooting experience for everyone.  though I could see it as being offputting to someone that doesn't realize why.\n\nAll in all it was a very fun experience, the Sales staff was helpful in letting me see and handle a number of firearms when I arrived before the rest of my party.  and the range was nice for a pistol range.  It's also less than 2 miles from my  workplace so I could definitely see stopping by here for an hour after a bad day.\n\nOh and I almost forgot the clerk forgot somehow I didn't get charged for my rangetime and I still have 2  1 hour rangepasses, so I may be stopping by sooner than you think.  I know it's not something to rate a business on, but I doubt it ever upsets the customer.",

The interior was more reminiscient of a bowling alley with ugly carpeting and uncomfortable orange and yellow chairs.  Above the bar hangs an Air Cav unit emblem indicating the proprietor spent some time in Nam and it in no way embodies an italian restaurant hopefully the food is good.\n\nWe started with an order of toasted ravioli which was actually quite good, My meal included a salad and breadstick (singular).  The salad consisted of tomatoes, lettuce and onions.  Not being a fan of Tomatoes or Onions I reached for the parmesan and made the best of things.  \n\n(NOTE: There are these things call croutons, they're crunchy and they're awesome!!!)\n\nI was also served a single lonely breadstick in a basket, feeling guilty I shared the breadstick with my wife.  \n\nFor dinner I had ordered the linguine with clam sauce.  I ordered a half order but the portion size was still very big.  there was a lot of clam on the pasta, unfortunately the sauce was a bit of a let down and something was off about the taste.  My wife had ordered a stromboli but we couldn't help but think she was eating an oversized hot pocket.\n\nThe service was ok, our waiter was young and seemed absent minded and a couple of times we joked about dine and dashing because we were going to catch a movie after.\n\nTo be fair it was mothers day and the wait staff may have been off their game.  and the pizza looked good so at some point I'd like to come back and try the pizza.  the pizza will determine whether they gain or lose a star.\n\nIf you're in the neighborhood might be worth checking out, but not worth the drive if you're not.",
